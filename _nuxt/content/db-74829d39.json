Diese benutzt das Budgie Desktop Environment, welches ein ähnliches Layout wie ChromeOS oder Windows bietet. Diese Edition ist am beliebtesten und die beste Wahl. \n- Die **GNOME Edition**, with the GNOME desktop environment designed to be elegant and modern. This is the variant you want if you would like a simple, unique experience.\n- Die **Pantheon Edition**, featuring elementary OS' Pantheon Desktop, made to be familiar to users coming from macOS.\n- Die **Cutefish Edition**, an experimental version using the Cutefish desktop environment, this is currently the smallest variant, but the Cutefish desktop itself is far from finished, and is heavily under development.\n- **Ultramarine Lapis**, an OSTree-based variant of the Flagship edition. This variant is designed to be completely immutable, which means the system image itself is not modifiable. This is a variant recommended for non-technical users, or users who mostly work with container-based environments.\n\nUltramarine Linux is only compatible with x86_64 (AMD64) systems. This is usually the case for most modern computers. On Macs, this means that Ultramarine Linux only supports Intel Macs.\n\nThe ISO images are available for download from the [Ultramarine Linux website](https://ultramarine-linux.org).\n\n## Checking the integrity of the ISO image (Recommended)\n\nIf you would like to make sure the ISO image is valid, Ultramarine ISO images all come with a `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.\n\nThe checksum file is a SHA256 checksum of the ISO image, you can use the following command to check the integrity of the ISO image (if you're using another Linux distribution)\n\n```bash\nsha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso # Generate the checksum for the ISO image\ncat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum\n\n# Now you can compare the checksum\n\n```\n\n### Verifying the checksum on Windows\n```powershell\nCertUtil -hashfile PATH\\TO\\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256\n# Open the CHECKSUM file with Nodepad and compare the checksum\n```\n\n## Creating the bootable media\n\n### With Ultramarine Linux\n\nYou can use the Fedora Media Writer to create a bootable media from the ISO image.\n![](/assets/fedoramediawriter.png)\n\n### With other operating systems (Windows, macOS, other Linux distributions)\n\nYou can use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable media from the ISO image.\n\n![](/assets/balenaetcher.png)\n\n### With Windows (alternative)\n\nYou can use [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/) to create the bootable image.\n\n![](/assets/rufus_en.png)\n\n\n## Booting to Ultramarine Linux\n\nAfter flashing the image to your USB drive, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the drive and restarting your computer.\n\nBefore your computer boots to your current OS, please refer to your computer's documentation on which key to press to select a custom boot option.\n\n<alert type='info'>\n\nMost BIOS has a special key that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the BIOS setup screen.

In this article, we will cover the basics of how to get started developing in Ultramarine.\n\nIf you would like to develop your own software, you can get started with the section below.\n\nIf you would like to develop **for** Ultramarine, you can get started with the [Developing for Ultramarine](#developing-for-ultramarine) section.\n\n## Getting Started\n\nUltramarine comes with the [Python programming language](https://www.python.org/) out of the box, which is also required for most Fedora and Ultramarine\nsoftware, including the DNF package manager itself.\n\n### Setting up Rust\n\nTo set up Rust in your environment, you can install the Rust and Cargo package from the Fedora repositories.\n\n```zsh\nsudo dnf install rustc cargo\n```\n\nYou can also use the `rustup` installer from the [Rust website](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install). This will install Rust in your local environment.\n\n## Developing for Ultramarine\n\nOur main IDE is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), which is an open-source (mostly source-available) IDE that is available for both Windows, macOS, and Linux.\n\nIf you, however, do not prefer to use the official Microsoft distribution of Visual Studio Code, you can also use [VSCodium](https://www.vscodium.com/), which is a free alternative distribution of Visual Studio Code. Or you can also use the [Official open-source build of Visual Studio Code](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode) here.\n\nThere are also other supported IDEs and software we recommend using for development, such as:\n\n- [JetBrains CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/) (Native applications with C/C++, or Rust)\n- [JetBrains PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) for Python development.\n- [GNOME Builder](https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Builder) for GNOME and GTK development.\n- [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/product/development-tools) for Qt development.\n\nAnd other text editors you can use, such as:\n\n- [VIM](https://www.vim.org/)\n- [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/)\n- [Micro](https://micro-editor.github.io/)\n- [Neovim](https://neovim.io/)\n- [Helix](https://helix-editor.com/)\n\nThese text editors come with a minimal set of features, so you may want to install plugins for them, and configure them to your liking.\n\nOur preferred programming languages are Python, Vala and Rust, and our preferred GUI library is Helium.\n\nTo build packages for Ultramarine, see [Using Andaman](/development/anda).\n\n### UI development\n\nIt is recommended to follow the [Helium Human Interface Guidelines](https://developers.tauos.co/docs/hig) for UI development for Ultramarine apps. However, if you think that the Helium guidelines limit aspects of your app, you can deviate from the Helium guidelines and do your own UI design.\n\n### Build systems\n\nFor build systems, we prefer using the programming language's native build system. For example, if you're using Rust, you can use the Rust's native Cargo build system. And in the case of Python, you can use the standard Python setuptools, which consists of either a `setup.py` file or a `pyproject.toml` file.\n\nFor cases where using a native build system does not fit the needs of the application, we have a prioritized list of build systems that we recommend using:\n\n- [Meson](https://mesonbuild.com/)\n- [CMake](https://cmake.org/)\n- [GNU Autotools](https://www.gnu.org/software/automake/manual/html_node/Autotools-Introduction.html)\n- A standard makefile.\n","dir":"/en/development","path":"/en/development/developing-for-ultramarine","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-01-22T09:24:22.972Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-22T09:24:22.972Z","to":"/development/developing-for-ultramarine","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1674379521293},"$loki":6},{"slug":"ux-guide","description":"Guidelines for how the Ultramarine Linux experience should be designed.","title":"UX Guidelines","position":42,"category":"Development","toc":[{"id":"theming","depth":2,"text":"Theming"},{"id":"ux","depth":2,"text":"UX"},{"id":"de-choice","depth":2,"text":"DE Choice"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Ultramarine Linux is supposed to be a user-friendly desktop operating system, and stay out the way of the user.

A traditional way to do this is to do it through the shell.\n\nThe shell is a command line interface to the operating system. It is a program that wraps around the operating system kernel, and allows you to directly execute system calls and commands to interact with the operating system.\n\nThere are many various shells that are available on Linux, such as:\n\n- The Bourne shell (sh)\n- The Bourne-again shell (bash)\n- The Korn shell (ksh)\n- The Z shell (zsh)\n- The Friendly Interactive Shell (fish)\n\nUltramarine Linux uses the [Z Shell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) as its default shell, combined with the [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/) for a more clean interface.\n\n\n<alert>\n\nTo learn more about shell scripting, you can watch this Bash introduction video by Fireship here:\n\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/I4EWvMFj37g\" title=\"YouTube video player\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n\nNOTE: The Z shell is mostly compatible with Bash, so most of the knowledge you will learn will be mostly applicable in Ultramarine Linux.\n\n</alert>\n\n\n<alert>\n\nThe Z shell is also used Kali Linux and newer versions of macOS (Catalina and newer).\n\n</alert>\n\n## Interacting with the shell\n\nTo start using the shell, open the Terminal app.\n\n![The GNOME Terminal](/assets/terminal.png)\n\nYou will be greeted with a prompt, simply type in the command you want to execute, and press `Enter⏎`.\n\nTo change directories, type `cd` followed by the path you want to change to.\n\n```zsh\ncd /home/user/Documents\n```\n\nTo list the contents of a directory, type `ls`.\n\nTo read a file to the terminal, type `cat` followed by the path to the file.\n\n```zsh\ncat /home/user/Documents/README.md\n```\n\nTo delete a file, type `rm` followed by the path to the file.\n\n```zsh\nrm /home/user/Documents/README.md\n```\n\nTo delete a full directory, recursively delete it by typing `rm -r` followed by the path to the directory.\n\n```zsh\nrm -r /home/user/Documents\n```\n\n<alert>\n\nMost users will usually execute `rm -rf` instead of `rm -r`. The `-f` flag is used to force the deletion of a file or directory.\n\n</alert>\n\nTo create a new file, type `touch` followed by the path to the file.\n\n```zsh\ntouch /home/user/Documents/newfile.txt\n```\n\nTo create a new directory, type `mkdir` followed by the path to the directory.\n\n```zsh\nmkdir /home/user/Documents/newdir\n```\n\nTo move or rename a file or directory, type `mv` followed by the path to the file or directory, and then the new path.\n\n```zsh\nmv /home/user/Documents/newfile.txt /home/user/Documents/newfile2.txt\n```\n\nTo know more about each command, open the manual by typing `man` followed by what you want to learn about\n\n```\nman sudo\n```\n\nThis will open `less`, an app that allows you to read through long lines of text as a scrollable page.\n\nTo exit `less` press `Q`.\n\nMost commands will also have a `-h` or `--help` flag, which tells you more about the command.\n\n## The Pipeline\n\nLinux offers a way for inter-process communication through pipes.\n\nThe pipeline you to transfer data from one process to another, and is used to execute commands in parallel.\n\n```zsh\necho \"Hello World\" | wc -w\n```\n\nThis calls the `wc` (word count) command, which counts the number of words in the text. Then pipes the output of `echo` to it, which then outputs the number of words. This is a very simple example of a pipeline.\n\nA named pipe is created by using `>` instead of `|`.\n\n```zsh\necho \"Hello World\" > pipe.txt\n```\n\nThis pipes the output of `echo` to the named pipe `pipe.txt`, which is now a file.\n\n\n## Executing a file\n\nTo execute a program, you must first make sure that the file is executable. This is done by using the `chmod` command.\n\n```bash\nchmod +x /path/to/exec\n```\n\nThen you can execute the file by directly pointing to it.\n\n```bash\n/path/to/exec\n```\n\nFor files in your current folder, you must use `./` before the file name.\n\n```bash\n./exec\n```","dir":"/en/linux","path":"/en/linux/shell","extension":".md","createdAt":"2023-01-22T09:24:22.972Z","updatedAt":"2023-01-22T09:24:22.972Z","to":"/linux/shell","meta":{"version":0,"revision":0,"created":1674379521458},"$loki":14},{"slug":"software","description":"This wiki is meant to be the extended documentation for both end users and developers, so it is separated in those two categories.","title":"Software and package management","position":22,"category":"Linux Concepts","toc":[{"id":"the-system-package-manager","depth":2,"text":"The system package manager"},{"id":"other-package-managers","depth":2,"text":"Other package managers"},{"id":"flatpak","depth":3,"text":"Flatpak"},{"id":"snap","depth":3,"text":"Snap"},{"id":"steam","depth":3,"text":"Steam"},{"id":"other-installation-methods","depth":2,"text":"Other installation methods"},{"id":"appimages","depth":3,"text":"AppImages"},{"id":"install-from-source","depth":3,"text":"Install from source"}],"body":{"type":"root","children":[{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"There are many different ways to install software on Linux."}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"h2","props":{"id":"the-system-package-manager"},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"a","props":{"ariaHidden":"true","href":"#the-system-package-manager","tabIndex":-1},"children":[{"type":"element","tag":"span","props":{"className":["icon","icon-link"]},"children":[]}]},{"type":"text","value":"The system package manager"}]},{"type":"text","value":"\n"},{"type":"element","tag":"p","props":{},"children":[{"type":"text","value":"Most software is installed using the system package manager.

Uninstalling this package may not fix the issue on an already configured account. Simply remove the bookmarks yourself.\n\n\n### Anaconda shows a warning about the system being pre-release\n\nThis is caused by Anaconda not finding the patched `/.buildinfo` file (or ProductMD information about Ultramarine).

This is a known issue, but there is no known fix as of yet. (Possibly an upstream bug, help needed.)\n\n## Pantheon\n\n### Missing Switchboard (Settings) menus\n\nThis was caused by missing Pantheon Switchboard modules, which are not included in Ultramarine
