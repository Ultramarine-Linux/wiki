## Choosing Your Edition

Ultramarine Chromebook comes in 4 variants:

- **Xfce Edition**: A lightweight and elegant experience designed to help you squeeze the most out of your device, or revive an old one.
- **Budgie Edition**: A familiar and stylish experience with a bit of flair.
- **GNOME Edition**: A simple, elegant, and intuitive desktop with a large ecosystem of apps and extensions.

## Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine ISO (Recommended)

Ultramarine ISO images have a matching `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View Checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/chromebook).

### Verifying the Checksum on Linux and macOS

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the images:

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.img # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on ChromeOS

You can use the [ChromeOS Linux Container](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux) to verify the image on ChromeOS

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.img # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on Windows

In Powershell, run this command:

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the CHECKSUM file with Notepad and compare the checksum
```

## Creating the Installer

### Download [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable media from the img image.

Simply select the img file, a device to use for the installer, and click flash.



## Footnotes

- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Since Fedora 37, Fedora's official support for the Pantheon desktop environment has been dropped due to compatibility issues and the Pantheon port is now maintained by the Ultramarine Linux team. This means that the Pantheon desktop environment is only available through Ultramarine Linux, or Fedora with Terra enabled.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
