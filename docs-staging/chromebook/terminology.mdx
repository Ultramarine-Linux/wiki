title: Chromebook Terminology
description: "Get to Know Chromebook Terms"
---

The Chromebook Community, (and Google themselves) have made terminology for many of the practices and quirks of Chrome hardware.

### Chromium OS

Where the magic happens. Just like Chrome proper, Chrome OS is a derivative of the open source Chromium OS.

### Chrome OS

The consumer variant of Chromium OS found on all Chrome devices.

### Write Protect (WP)

Usually refers to Firmware Write Protect (FW_WP), a feature of Chromebooks that marks a region of the ROM that holds firmware as read-only. It is possible (and rather easy) to remove the protection on most Chromebooks. [1]

#### Cr50/Battery WP

One of the methods for implementing write protect, WP is enabled when a battery is connected, and disabled when the battery is removed. [1]

#### WP Switch

This is just a toggle, not much to explain here. [1]

#### WP Screw

The primary implementation of write protect on older devices, a screw shorts a connection, WP can be disabled by removing the short. Most of the time the screw is removed, but you could in theory place Kapton tape over the pad. [1]

### Closed Case Debugging (CCD)

Allows people with cr50 to disable WP without opening the device. This requires a special cable called suzyQ. [1] [2]

### Verified Boot

Tamper protection, it's signing essentially. [3]

### Developer Mode

Loosens verified boot and gives you the ability to enable USB/SD boot and elevate to root.

### ChromeEC

EC Refers to a lot of things, and it's honestly better to read the [official docs](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/ec/+/HEAD/README.md#Terminology) on this one.

### Depthcharge

Depthcharge is the stock firmware on your Chromebook. Unless you somehow have an original Chromebook

#### Depthcharge Manipulation

A method to run Linux on Chromebooks without modifying the stock firmware by tricking said firmware (Depthcharge) into booting a Linux kernel. This is what we are using.

### altFW/Custom Firmware [5]

altFW is the Chrultrabook Project's name for custom firmware.

#### Coreboot/Full ROM

Coreboot replaces the original firmware on your Chromebook with full UEFI.

#### RW_Legacy

RW_Legacy allows you to use the included BIOS on your Chromebook.

#### Firmware Utility Script/MrChromebox's Script

A popular tool used to manage and install custom firmware

### Auto Update Expiration

When Google stops providing updates for a Chromebook. Usually 10 years after the release. You can see a list of [AUE Dates here](https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/6220366?hl=en).

### Codename

Refers to a specific Chromebook, this may be the same as the board name (For example: Caroline and Chell are also the board name for their respective models)

### Board Name

Refers to the motherboard, these may be shared across Chromebooks (For example: Hana (board) is used on hana, maple, sycamore, and telesu)

### Baseboard

Exactly what it sounds like, a board that acts as the base for others (For example: Caroline, Chell, and Cave are all based on Glados, see the reference)

### Chrultrabook

Our partners in crime. Chrultrabook builds drivers and other tools for Chrome hardware. The name is a portmanteau from "*Chr*omebook to *Ultra*book"

### Chromebook Plus

Google's branding for Chromebooks at what would be the entry level for standard laptops [4]

### Premium Chromebook

Kinda official term to refer to higher spec Chromebooks. The Pixelbooks, Framework, and some of the nicer HPs fall into this category

### Gaming Chromebook

No real definition besides an RGB keyboard, specs and price are all over the place
