### The Helium Human Interface Guidelines Can Be Found on [Fyra Developer](https://developer.fyralabs.com/helium/hig) 

We now recommend the Helium Human Interface Guidelines. They're built in house to provide a modern and friendly experience. Although they are designed for the Helium UI Library, you can apply the principles to any UI library.

These guidelines are not a be-all-end-all and you are free to ignore parts or add your own ideals. It's your app after all :P
