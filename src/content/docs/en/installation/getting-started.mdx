 </Alert>

Ultramarine Linux is distributed with a file called an ISO, these are available for download from [our website](https://ultramarine-linux.org).

### Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine ISO (Recommended)

Ultramarine ISO images have a matching `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View Checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/).

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the ISO image:

### Verifying the checksum on Linux

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso # Generate the checksum for the ISO image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the checksum on Windows

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the CHECKSUM file with Nodepad and compare the checksum
```

## Creating the Installer

### On other operating systems (Windows, macOS, other Linux distributions)

Use [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) to create a bootable media from the ISO image.

## Booting the Installer

After flashing the image to your USB drive, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the drive and restarting your computer.

Before your computer boots to your current OS, please refer to your computer's documentation on which key to press to select a custom boot option.

<Alert type='info'>

Most computers have a special key that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the setup screen. This varies from brand to brand. These keys may be `Esc`, one of the function keys,, or even `Delete`. The BIOS will usually display a message on the screen briefly on startup. If you're not sure which key to press, look up the key for your computer manufacturer.
