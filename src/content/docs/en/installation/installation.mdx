After booting into the live system, you will see a dialog box asking you whether to start the installer or continue with the live system.

![The Welcome Dialog box](/assets/welcome-window.png)

You can pick whichever you want, and you'll be able to start the installer later by opening the `Install to Hard Drive` application.

## Language Selection

After starting the installer, you will be greeted with a language selection screen. Simply choose the language and keyboard layout you would like to use.

## The Anaconda Hub & Spoke Model

![Anaconda Hub](/assets/anaconda-2.png)

Anaconda uses a hub and spoke model. You can configure your installation in any order you want, but you will need to complete all the options before you can continue.

### Keyboard Layouts

![Anaconda Keyboard Layout](/assets/anaconda-3.png)

Press the `+` button to add a new keyboard layout, then pick and search for the keyboard layout you prefer.

Once you have selected the keyboard layout, you can press the `Done` button on the top left to go back to the hub.

### Time & Date

The Time & Date selection screen has a world map where you can click on your location on the map to set your timezone.

<Alert type="info">

By default, the time is set from your IP address geolocation. If you're using a VPN or proxy this may not be accurate.

</Alert>

### Storage

![](/assets/anaconda-5.png)

This is where you select where you want Ultramarine to be installed, you can have the installer automatically partition your disk, or, select a custom layout.

By default, Ultramarine uses [Btrfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs) on standard computers. We default to ext4 on Chromebooks as Btrfs may shorten the life of the EMMC found in most Chromebooks.

<Alert type="info">
  We recommend encrypting your disk for added security. Simply select the
  "Encrypt" checkbox, you will be prompted to enter a new password after
  pressing done, and the password you provided to the installer on every boot.
</Alert>

#### Custom Partitioning

![](/assets/anaconda-6.png)

In this mode, you can have Anaconda automatically setup partitions for you, or, manually configure the layout of the disk.

On UEFI-based systems, you need a partition mounted as `/boot/EFI` and another mounted as `/`.

On BIOS-based systems, you need a `BIOSBoot` partition, a parition mounted as `/boot` and another mounted as `/`.

#### Advanced Partitioning

![](/assets/anaconda-7.png)

In this mode, Anaconda uses a tool called blivet-gui for you to manually partition your drive. This mode provides more freedom, so make sure you know what you're doing.

### Networking

![](/assets/anaconda-8.png)

On this screen, you can configure the hostname for the installed system. This is what other computers call your device.

### User Accounts

![](/assets/anaconda-9.png)

In this screen, you must set up a user account. This account will be the administrator for the installed system.

You can also click on the `Advanced` button for a more in-depth configuration of your account, such as your user folder location, account ID, and your group membership.

<Alert type="warning">

You must enter a password. Applications may misbehave without one.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

If you type in an insecure password, you must press the "Done" button twice to continue.

</Alert>

After completing your system configuration, press the `Begin Installation` button to continue. The installation process will start and may take a few minutes.

<Alert type="danger">
  This process is **IRREVERSIBLE**. If you manage to stop the installer before
  it finishes, you will end up with a broken system. <br /> To fix this, you
  will have to reinstall Ultramarine Linux or your preferred operating system.
</Alert>

After the installation process is complete, Anaconda will prompt you to reboot your device, simply reboot and enjoy!

Welcome to Ultramarine Linux!
