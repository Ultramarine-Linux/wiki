After installing Ultramarine Linux, There are a few things you should do to make the most out of your new system.

## Install NVIDIA Drivers

If you have an NVIDIA Graphics Card, you must install the latest drivers for it by running the following commands:

```bash
sudo dnf update # Update the system first, the drivers may not work right if you don't.
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia # Install the NVIDIA kernel module.
```
Then, reboot your system.

<Alert type="warning">
  
You MUST wait until the process is finished before rebooting. Rebooting too early might result in a broken installation!

### Use NVIDIA Graphics Card as the primary card on Optimus Laptops

Run the following commands to make your NVIDIA Graphics Card the primary Graphics Card:

```bash
sudo cp -p /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf
sudo sed -i '10i\        Option "PrimaryGPU" "yes"' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf # Add PrimaryGPU = yes to the 10th line of the file.
```

Then reboot your system. 

Make sure you're using the Xorg version of your desktop environment.

## Install Codecs

Ultramarine Linux includes codecs for most of the media you'll come across. You shouldn't need to install any additional codecs.

## Set up Snapper (Btrfs Snapshots)
Currently, RPM's architecture does not handle snapper properly. You might experience broken RPM transactions when doing rollbacks. This is a known issue and must be addressed upstream.
