## System Requirements

Ultramarine Linux supports the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. Please see the [Anywhere page](/en/anywhere/rpi) for more information.

## Selecting a Drive

The drive you use deeply affects the experience you will have on Ultramarine.

### Raspberry Pi 3

Raspberry Pi 3 supports only microSD cards. Your microSD card must be 9GB or larger, but we suggest 16GB or more so you'll have some space for software.

You should also look for a class 10 SDHC or SDXC microSD.

### Raspberry Pi 4 and 400

Raspberry Pi 4 supports microSD cards and USB storage. Your storage device must be 9GB or larger, but we suggest 16GB or more so you'll have some space for software.

The best experience will be with a SATA SSD connected over an adapter. A USB 3.0 flash drive will be slightly better to on-par with a nice microSD card. All of the options are good, it's up to your needs.

## Flashing the Image

Grab a USB stick! Use a flasher program to create an installer from the image. [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is an easy cross-platform choice.

Simply select the raw.xz file (you don't need to decompress it), a device to use for the installer, and click flash.

You can also use the Disks application on Flagship, Xfce, and GNOME editions. Raspberry Pi Imager is not compatible with our images.

## Expanding the Root Filesystem

<Alert type="info">
  This is not possible on Windows or macOS. We are figuring out a way to do this
  on first boot.
</Alert>

If you haven't already, install GParted as an RPM [from your app store](/en/linux/software).

Start by opening GParted, it may prompt you to fix the GPT, you can safely select "Fix"

Then click the green check in the top menu and confirm the changes.

Sit back and wait, this may take upwards of five minutes.

You're done now! You can exit this menu and eject your drive, you're ready to plug it into your Pi!

## First Boot

On first boot, you'll be prompted with your edition's login screen. The username and password are both `ultramarine`, change this password ASAP.

That's it! You're ready to enjoy Ultramarine on your Raspberry Pi! We're working hard on making the experience better so stay tuned!
