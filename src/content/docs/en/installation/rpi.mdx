## System Requirements

Ultramarine Linux supports the Raspberry Pi 3 and 4. Please see the [Anywhere page](/en/anywhere/rpi) for more information.

## Selecting a Drive

The drive you use deeply affects the experience you will have on Ultramarine.

### Raspberry Pi 3 and Zero 2

These models support only microSD cards. Your storage device must be 16GB or larger.

You should also look for a class 10 SDHC or SDXC microSD.

### Raspberry Pi 4, 400

Raspberry Pi 4 supports microSD cards and USB storage. Your storage device must be 16GB or larger.

The best experience will be with a SATA SSD connected over an adapter. A USB 3.0 flash drive will be slightly better to on-par with a nice microSD card. All of the options are good, it's up to your needs.

If you opt to use a USB device, make sure it's USB 3, USB 2 will be unusable for most usecases.

### Raspberry Pi 5

Raspberry Pi 5 supports microSD cards, USB storage, and m.2 drives (SATA and NVMe.) Your storage device must be 16GB or larger.

The best experience will be with a m.2 SSD, there's many HATs and boards that will allow you to do this, but when in doubt the [official HAT](https://www.raspberrypi.com/products/m2-hat-plus/) is a good choice. All of the options are good, it's up to your needs.

If you opt to use a USB device, make sure it's USB 3, USB 2 will be unusable for most usecases.

## Flashing the Image

<Alert type="info">
  If you're using a Raspberry Pi 4 or 5, you can skip these steps and use
  Raspberry Pi Imager! Either insert an empty microSD and press shfit at
  startup, or use it on another device.
</Alert>

First, you will need to decompress it.

- On Linux, run `unzstd *FILENAME.img.zst*`, you may need to install the `zstd` package
- On Windows 11 or ChromeOS, zstd is natively supported. Decompress like you would a Zip file.
- On Windows 10, use 7zip or WinRaR
- On macOS, install `zstd` from Homebrew (`brew install zstd`), then `unzstd *FILENAME.img.zst*`.

Grab a USB stick or SD Card! Use a flasher program to flash Ultramarine to your storage device. [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is an easy cross-platform choice.

Simply select the .img file, the device you're using, and click flash.

You can also use the Disks application on Flagship, Xfce, and GNOME editions.

## First Boot

On first boot, the root file system will automatically be expanded, you’ll be prompted with a user creation screen. Create your user and you’ll be ready to go!

That’s it! You’re ready to enjoy Ultramarine on your Raspberry Pi! We’re working hard on making the experience better so stay tuned!
