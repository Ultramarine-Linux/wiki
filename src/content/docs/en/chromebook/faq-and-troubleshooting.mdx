## Troubleshooting

<Alert type="warning">
  If your issue still persists after reading this page, hop into [our
  chats](/en/community/community) and make a support forum post.
</Alert>

### Chromebook fails to boot to internal disk

Assuming 'Boot to Internal Disk', or pressing <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> does not fully boot (usually only to Submarine, the boot entries screen before Ultramarine boots), the device has probably died. Plug in your Chromebook.

### Keyboard is not properly mapped

Try re-installing the cros-keyboard-map package. Simply run ` sudo dnf install cros-keyboard-remap`. If this does not work, try running this command:

```
sudo systemctl enable cros-keyboard-map
```

If this does not work, try running WeirdTreeThing's [keyd script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/cros-keyboard-map).

### Chromebook Audio Doesn't Work

This should not happen unless you have unsupported speakers, but if it does, try running WeirdTreeThing's [audio script](https://github.com/WeirdTreeThing/chromebook-linux-audio) manually.

You may have an audio device unsupported by the audio script by default (max98357a Sound controller). If you would like to enable audio on here, run the script manually and follow the prompts to enable audio.

<Alert type="warning">
  max98357a, and any other audio devices requiring ```--force-avs-install``` is
  not recommended to enable, and support will not be given to damaged speakers.
  If you really want to proceed, do not raise your speakers volume high or they
  will get damaged.
</Alert>

### USBC/Thunderbolt doesn't work

You probably have an 11th or 12th gen Intel CPU. We have a systemd service packaged in terra that will fix this:

```
sudo dnf install chromebook-usbc-fix
```
your USBC ports should immediatly work after package installation. If it does not, try a reboot. If it still doesn't work:

```
sudo systemctl enable chromebook-usbc-fix
```
This package may also work on 13th gen or higher platforms.

## FAQs

### Why Doesn’t [Insert Hardware Feature] Work?

All hardware should work on almost every supported Chromebook model, but some specific Chromebooks may have some missing features (ex. Drallion, Sarien, and Arcada have a Wilco (Dell Enterprise) EC, and may have missing features).

### Is this legal?

Yes, it is perfectly legal. Chromebooks and ChromeOS are backed by the [Chromium Projects' ChromiumOS](https://www.chromium.org/chromium-os/}). All information on how to mod Chromebooks is on this site, and open to anyone to use.

### Will the installer boot through a USB 2.0/3.0 adaptor/hub?

Yes.

### Why not just run [MrChromebox's Firmware Utility Script?](https://mrchromebox.tech/#fwscript)

The goal here is to be as easy and safe to use as possible. It is also easier to go back to ChromeOS if you keep the stock firmware. With that being said, we fully support the use of mrchromebox's script, it has many great use cases.

### Will this make my Chromebook faster?

It often does, as Ultramarine can be more lightweight then ChromeOS, but we do not guarantee a preformance gain vs ChromeOS.
If you are using an older/slower Chromebook and want to maximize performance, we reccomend using Xfce or Flagship edition.

### Should I Buy a Chromebook Instead of a Regular Laptop Now?

Generally, it is reccomended not to, however you can get really good Chromebook deals if you know where to look. Keep in mind they will by nature be less stable, and more involved then a regular laptop. A good rule of thumb is to always have a regular laptop handy incase you need it.

### I Thought Ultramarine Used Btrfs?

Ultramarine proper does, but due to Btrfs's advanced features, it is not very good on eMMC storage (used by most Chromebooks). We use F2Fs (Flash-Friendly file system) to prolong the life of eMMC as much as we can. We plan on adding more file system options in the near future.

### This Installer Looks Different, What Is It?

We are using our in-house installer [Readymade](https://github.com/FyraLabs/readymade). We always intended to use our own installer in Ultramarine, but Chromebook Edition is the first to use it due to the limitations of other installers. Chromebook Edition uses an early version of Readymade with pretty basic features, enough for a Chromeobok install. We hope to have a more complete build of Readymade for Ultramarine 41.
