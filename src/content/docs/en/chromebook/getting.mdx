## Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine ISO (Recommended)

Ultramarine ISO images have a matching `CHECKSUM` file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View Checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/chromebook).

### Verifying the Checksum on Linux and macOS

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the images:

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.img # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on ChromeOS

You can use the [ChromeOS Linux Container](https://chromeos.dev/en/linux) to verify the image on ChromeOS

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.img # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/CHECKSUM # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on Windows

In Powershell, run this command:

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the CHECKSUM file with Notepad and compare the checksum
```

## Creating the Installer on Windows, macOS, or Linux

## Footnotes

- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
