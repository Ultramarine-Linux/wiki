Before we insert the installer, we will need to do a few things with your ChromeOS device.

### 1. Back up your data (optional)

Step 2 will wipe all local data from your device, If you have any files you wish to save or move to Ultramarine Chromebook, back up your data off the device, either to the cloud or locally. For a small number of files, we recommend backing up to Google Drive, or another cloud storage provider. For a larger number of files, we recommend backing up to an external storage medium, such as a USB flash drive (seperate from the one you will turn into the instaler) or other external drive.

If you choose to back up with Google Drive, you will be prompted to add your Google Drive to the Ultramarine Chromebook file manager in the GNOME, KDE, and Flagship editions during setup to easily access and redownload your data.

### 2. Enable developer mode

<Alert type="warning">Enabling developer mode will wipe your data</Alert>

#### Developer mode on Chromebooks (ChromeOS laptops only):

1. Shut down the device, then hold <kbd>esc</kbd> + <kbd>⟳</kbd> + <kbd>⏻ [power]</kbd> to enter Recovery mode.
2. When you see a screen that says 'ChromeOS is missing or damaged,' press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.
3. You may be prompted with 'To turn OS verification off, press enter,' press <kbd>Enter</kbd>.
4. A screen saying 'OS verification is off, press space to re-enable' should appear, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.
   Your system is now transitioning into Developer Mode! (This may take a few minutes)
5. After it has transitioned, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to boot back into ChromeOS as a developer. You are now ready for step 3

#### Developer Mode on Chromeboxes and Chromebases (ChromeOS Desktops and All-in-ones):

<Alert type="warning">
  Not all monitors will work with the Chromebox OS Verification screens. This
  typically happens if the monitor has a resolution greater then 1080p. If your
  Chromebox appeared to boot (lights on) but does not output anything, you can
  attempt to continue without a display.
</Alert>

1.  Shut down the device, then insert a paper clip (SIM ejector tool works great too!) into the RECOVERY BUTTON (small hole usually near the ports, see your hardware documentation for exact location) and reboot. You will then be greeted with the "OS Verification is turned off" screen.
2.  Plug in a keyboard and press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>. You may be prompted with 'To turn OS verification off, press RECOVERY BUTTON,' press RECOVERY BUTTON.
3.  A screen saying 'OS verification is off, press space to re-enable' should appear, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd>.
    Your system is now transitioning into Developer Mode! (This may take a few minutes).
4.  After it has transitioned, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>D</kbd> to boot back into ChromeOS as a developer. You are now ready for step 3.

#### Developer Mode on ChromeOS Tablets:

1.  Shut down the device, then press and hold <kbd>Power</kbd>+<kbd>Volume-Up</kbd>+<kbd>Volume-Down</kbd> for 3-5 seconds, then release to invoke recovery mode. This is a bit finicky, and may take a few tries, but the screen will turn white and display a screen saying "Please insert a recovery USB stick." soon after button release.
2.  To boot to Developer mode, simultaneously press <kbd>Volume-Up</kbd>+<kbd>Volume-Down</kbd>, or navigate to 'Developer Options' with the volume buttons, and select it with the power button. then select 'Boot From Internal Disk' using the volume buttons and power button.
    Your system is now transitioning into Developer Mode! (This may take a few minutes).
3.  After it has transitioned, again navigate to 'Developer Options,' then 'Boot From Internal Disk.' Plug in a keyboard, and you are now ready for step 3.

### 3. USB booting

1. In ChromeOS Developer mode, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F2</kbd>.
2. Type in 'chronos' for the login (there is no password, unless you set one previously. If you did, you probably know what you are doing).
3. Enter this command:

```
sudo enable_dev_usb_boot
```

4. You should have an output saying 'SUCCESS: Booting and self-assigned kernel from SSD/USB/SDCard slot is enabled.' Plug in your Ultramarine Chromebook installer and restart the device. If needed, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>Alt</kbd>+<kbd>F1</kbd> to leave the terminal.
5. Restarting the device will boot to the recovery screen. Upon reaching it, press <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>U</kbd>> to boot from USB/SD. If on a ChromeOS tablet, use the volume keys to navigate to 'Developer Options,' select using the Power Button, then select 'Boot to External Disk.'

### 4. Installing

After booting into the installer, you will see a dialog box asking you whether to start the installer or continue with the live system.

You can pick whichever you want, and you’ll be able to start the installer later by opening the Install to system application.
