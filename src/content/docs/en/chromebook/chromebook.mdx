With the help from our friends over at the [Chrultrabook Project](https://docs.chrultrabook.com/), we built a no-hassle way to boot full Ultramarine Linux on your Chromebook!

These pages will give you everything you need to know about what Ultramarine Chromebook is, how it works, how you can install it, and even how you can help us out!

If you would like more information about Ultramarine Chromebook, check out [the technical page](/en/everywhere/chromebook/) and [release announcement](https://blog.fyralabs.com/ultramarine-chromebook-edition-is-here/).
