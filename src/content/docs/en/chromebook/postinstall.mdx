import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

After Ultramarine Chromebook is fully installed and prompts you to reboot, you may safely remove your installer.

From here, you have an almost identical Ultramarine experience, however, we bundle the [Chrultrabook Controller](https://github.com/death7654/Chrultrabook-Tools) app by default to make controlling your Chromebook a bit easier.
With this app, you can set fan speeds, a battery charge limit, control the keyboard backlight, and monitor system resources.

And that's it! We hope you enjoy your 'new' device! Don't hesitate to reach out for support [in our chats](/en/community/community).
