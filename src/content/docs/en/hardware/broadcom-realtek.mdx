import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

Some computers with specific Broadcom or Realtek chipsets may require additional drivers to be installed.

You'll need to connect to the internet, you can do this via Ethernet or USB tethering from your phone. iPhones will automatically tether over USB when connected, Android phones may require you to switch the USB mode.

On Broadcom, install `broadcom-wl` and `kmod-wl`

```shell
sudo dnf install kmod-wl broadcom-wl
```

On Realtek, install `kmod-wl` only

```shell
sudo dnf install kmod-wl
```

Then reboot!
