Please review the [Linux Surface wiki page](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki) for your device, there may be important information in there.

#### Notes

- We do not and will **NEVER** support the Surface 1, 2, or RT.
- We do not support the Surface Pro X, and probably won't. If you'd like to change this you can [donate hardware](/en/contributing/contributorguide/#hardware).
- We do not support either Windows DevKit, and probably won't. If you'd like to change this you can [donate hardware](/en/contributing/contributorguide/#hardware).
- We do not support the "Copilot+ PC" Surfaces **YET**.
