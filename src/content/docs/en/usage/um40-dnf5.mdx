Starting with UM40, `dnf5` will replace `dnf-3` as the default package manager.
This is done via the `dnf5-default-package-manager` package provided by the UM40 repositories.

## Technical details

The `dnf5-default-package-manager` package has a `%triggerin` script for `dnf` and `yum`. When these
2 packages get installed/updated, the script will be executed, which will replace `/usr/bin/dnf` and
`/usr/bin/yum` symlinks to point to `/usr/bin/dnf5` instead of `/usr/bin/dnf-3`.

This change has been proposed on upstream Fedora, but has been delayed to Fedora 41. However, we've
decided this change should be worth a try on UM40.

## Effects

By using `dnf5`, users will be able to install, remove and upgrade packages much faster. End-users
shouldn't need to do anything to adapt to this change.

Since `dnf5` isn't bug-for-bug compatible with `dnf-3`, programs that rely on `dnf-3` should use the
`dnf-3` or `dnf4` command to use the older version of `dnf`. If you are facing compatibility issues
with some apps that rely on the `dnf` symlink instead of the actual `/usr/bin/dnf-3` binary, you are
advised to report this bug to upstreams (i.e. the apps in concern), not `dnf5` or Ultramarine.

## FAQ

### Why `dnf5`?

- `dnf5` provides better performance over `dnf-3` because it's written in C++ instead of Python.
- We hope this change will push apps in the Fedora neighborhood to switch to `dnf5` and at the same
  time discover apps that are poorly maintained/written and rely on `dnf`/`dnf-3`.

### Does UM40 remove `dnf`?

- We do not remove `dnf-3`. We only replace the symlinks for `dnf` and `yum` to point to `dnf5`.

### Wouldn't that break compatiblility?

- If changing only 2 symlinks actually breaks your workflows, either your workflows are poorly made,
  or there are some apps you use that rely on the 2 symlinks, which evinces that those apps are
  unfortunately poorly made. Change your workflows to adapt to `dnf5` or replace `dnf` with the
  actual `dnf-3` binary; or in the latter case, report the issue to the upstream apps in concern.

- We expect `dnf5` in the future to be supposedly much more compatible with `dnf-3`. Upstream Fedora
  has been working hard on making `dnf5` the replacement for `dnf-3`. There are works in progress to
  adapt GNOME software for `dnf5`, and to make `dnf5` much more feature-complete.

### But some features are missing in `dnf5`!

- There are efforts on making `dnf5` more feature-complete compared with `dnf-3`. You may help speed
  this up by [contributing to upstream](https://github.com/rpm-software-management/dnf5/).
