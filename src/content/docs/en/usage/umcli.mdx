umcli is a utility included in Ultramarine. It has many planned features, and this is a list of current and planned ones.

## Current Features

Syntax: `um` [global options] command [command options]

#### Global Options

`-h`, `--help` -- Display the `um` help screen if not attached to commands. Displays the Command's help page if run before a command. Just running `um` will also show the base `um` help screen.

#### Commands/Features

`status` -- Displays information about the system. This includes system version info, hardware overview, disk information, system status, network information, and more.

- `--upload` -- Creates a shareable link to view your system specs online. This information is end-to-end encrypted, auto-expires in 7 days, and not tied to you in any way.
- `--json` -- Outputs status in JSON format.

`tweaks` -- Manage Ultramarine Tweaks. Tweaks are Ansible playbooks or arbitrary shell scripts that modify the system following a preset. This can be used to configure specific software, change system settings, and more.

- `list` -- Lists all available tweaks.
- `enable TWEAK` -- Enables a tweak.
- `disable TWEAK` -- Disables a tweak.
- `run TWEAK` -- Runs a script tweak
- `--yes`, `-y` -- Automatically answer yes to all prompts. Use with caution.

## Planned Features

- umcli wrapper around the Nix language installer. Also pre-configure nix to instantly be able to have an easy to use experience.
- `umcli upgrade`, potentially a wrapper around the `topgrade` package. Would update everything on the system (system packages, flatpaks, firmware, etc.).
- `um get PACKAGE`. A way to easily install packages that are not in a common package repository, but do distribute their own RPMs, or their own repositories. Based on [deb-get](https://github.com/wimpysworld/deb-get)
- And more!
