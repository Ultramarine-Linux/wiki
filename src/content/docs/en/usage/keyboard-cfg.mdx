## Layouts

The default keyboard layout is English (US). You may change the keyboard layout in the respective desktop settings.

If you would like to type in another language, we have a dedicated [localization guide](/en/usage/l10n#inputting-in-another-language).

## Key remapping

`keyd` is a key remapping daemon that remaps keys using kernel level input primitives, making it a desirable solution across different desktop environments and window managers.

### Steps for simple configuration

1. Make sure you are a system administrator (i.e. you can run sudo)
2. Create a file `/etc/keyd/default.conf` and paste the example configuration below into it. Save the file.
3. Install `keyd` (from [Terra]): `sudo dnf install keyd`

Every time you have changed your configurations, you will need to reload them using `sudo keyd reload`

### Example configuration

```ini
[ids]

*

[main]

# Maps capslock to escape when pressed and control when held.
capslock = overload(control, esc)

# Remaps the escape key to capslock
esc = capslock
```

Lines starting with a `#` are comments, they will be ignored by `keyd`.

For more information, read the [Quickstart](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) section from upstream.

### Advanced configurations

`keyd` supports more advanced configurations, including

- mapping macros
- key timeouts
- custom layers / modifier keys (keys that can change behaviours of other keys when held, like shift, ctrl, alt, meta/winkey)
