Raspberry Pi is a very popular series of SBCs. They are cheap, easy to get, run Linux well, and have a large ecosystem of expansion cards (Hats and Bonnets) and accessories.

Raspberry Pi support in Ultramarine Linux is provided in partnership with the Raspberry Pi Foundation.

## Raspberry Pi 5

The Raspberry Pi 4 has had support in Ultramarine Linux since UM41. We use the Raspberry Pi Foundation's kernel and Fedora's boot proccess.

### Notes

- RPi 5 has a 2GB model, we suggest you don't run a desktop environment on this (Xfce may be alright.)
- The Pi 5 has native USB boot support. Your experience may be better with a fast USB Drive or SSD connected through an adapter. See [this article](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#usb-mass-storage-boot) for more info.
- The Pi 5 has native m.2 support. Your experience will be better with a NVMe SSD (compared to a USB-3 device or microSD card.)
- If using a microSD card, we reccomend using a Class 10 microSD card, your experience will be signifcantly better than lower classes.
- If using a USB drive, ensure it's USB 3.0 or newer, 2.0 will be a signifcantly worse experience than a microSD.
- Your storage device will need to be larger than 16GB (the image is ~15GB) We suggest 20GB so you have space for software.

## Raspberry Pi 4 and 400

The Raspberry Pi 4 and 400 have had support in Ultramarine Linux since UM39, and desktop images since UM40. We use the Raspberry Pi Foundation's kernel and Fedora's boot proccess.

### Notes

- RPi4B has a 1GB and 2GB model, we suggest you don't run a desktop environment on these (Xfce may be alright.)
- The Pi 4 series has native USB boot support. Your experience may be better with a fast USB Drive or SSD connected through an adapter. See [this article](https://www.raspberrypi.com/documentation/computers/raspberry-pi.html#usb-mass-storage-boot) for more info.
- If using a microSD card, we reccomend using a Class 10 microSD card, your experience will be signifcantly better than lower classes.
- If using a USB drive, ensure it's USB 3.0 or newer, 2.0 will be a signifcantly worse experience than a microSD.
- Your storage device will need to be larger than 16GB (the image is ~15GB) We suggest 20GB so you have space for software.

## Raspberry Pi 3

The Raspberry Pi 3 has had support in Ultramarine Linux since UM39, and desktop images since UM40. We use the Raspberry Pi Foundation's kernel and Fedora's boot proccess.

### Notes

- RPi3B has only 1GB of RAM, and the 3A only has 512MB, we suggest you don't run a desktop environment (Xfce may be alright.)
- Your microSD card will need to be larger than 16GB (the image is ~15GB) We suggest 20GB so you have space for software.
- We reccomend using a Class 10 microSD card, your experience will be signifcantly better than lower classes.

  subject to change.
</Alert>

## Raspberry Pi 1, 2, and Zero

<Alert type="info">
  These devices are **Not Supported** due to 32bit CPUs. We include them in this
  page to avoid questions.
</Alert>

## Installation

1. Install [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://flathub.org/apps/org.raspberrypi.rpi-imager).
2. Simply select "Other General Purpose OS" then your Ultramarine Edition of choice.
3. Insert the storage device into your Pi and boot up! The root filesystem will automatically be expanded.
4. You will be prompted to set up a user, do this and you're done!.
