import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

We have partnered with the [ASUS Linux project](https://asus-linux.org/) to make the ROG experience on Ultramarine easier.

## Setup

### Kernel

ASUS ROG devices from before 2022 can use the stock Ultramarine kernel.
ROG devices from 2023 onwards, you should consider using the CachyOS kernel, which may include more drivers for your device than the Fedora kernel used by default.
Ultramarine includes a `umcli` tweak to easily enable or disable the CachyOS kernel, information can be found [here](../usage/umcli)

### Packages

We have the following ASUS Linux/ASUS ROG support packages in Terra:
- [asusctl and rog-control-center](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl)
- [supergfxctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/supergfxctl)
- [gnome-shell-extension-gpu-switcher-supergfxctl](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7018/gpu-supergfxctl-switch/)

### TuneD Issues
If you are having issues with `tuned`, you may want to instead use `power-profiles-daemon`:

```
sudo dnf install power-profiles-daemon --allowerasing
systemctl enable --now power-profiles-daemon.service
```

#### Improve Battery on AMD Laptops

If you are using `power-profiles-daemon`, two features useful for ROG laptops are disabled by default; Panel power savings and AMDGPU Dynamic power management. These are specific to AMD iGPUs. Follow these steps to enable them:

Enable panel power savings:

```
powerprofilesctl configure-action amdgpu_panel_power --enable
```

Make sure this is above 0:

```
cat /sys/class/drm/card2/card2-eDP-2/amdgpu/panel_power_savings
```

Enable AMDGPU Dynamic power management:

```
powerprofilesctl configure-action amdgpu_dpm --enable
```

## Notes

- When installing `asusctl` and `supergfxctl`, These services will be pre-enabled: `asusd.service`, `asusd-user.service`, `superfgxd.service`.
- ROG Control Center is available in your app store, just search "ROG"!
