We have partnered with the Asus Linux project to provide an easy-to-setup Asus Linux setup in Ultramarine.

# Setup

## Kernel

2022 and below Asus ROG models can use the stock Ultramarine kernel.
For 2023 and above ROG models, you can use the CachyOS kernel, which may include more drivers for your device then the Fedora kernel that Ultramarine uses.
Ultramarine includes a `umcli` tweak to easily enable or disable the CachyOS kernel, information can be found [here](../usage/umcli)

## Packages

We have the following Asus Linux/Asus ROG device support packages in Terra:
- [asusctl and rog-control-center](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/asusctl)
- [supergfxctl](https://gitlab.com/asus-linux/supergfxctl)
- [gnome-shell-extension-gpu-switcher-supergfxctl](https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/7018/gpu-supergfxctl-switch/)

## TuneD Issues
If you are having issues with `tuned`, you may want to instead use `power-profiles-daemon`:

```
sudo dnf install power-profiles-daemon --allowerasing
systemctl enable --now power-profiles-daemon.service
```

Notes:
- When installing `asusctl` and `supergfxctl`, These services will be pre-enabled: `asusd.service`, `asusd-user.service`, `superfgxd.service`.
- ROG Control Center is available in your app store, just search "ROG"!
