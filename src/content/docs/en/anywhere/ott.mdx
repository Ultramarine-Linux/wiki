Smart TV boxes often run Android, which means we can use Halium to port Ultramarine to the unlockable ones. See [the Android page.](/en/anywhere/android)

This may be limited to FireOS devices as many of them are vulnerable to [mtk-su](https://xdaforums.com/t/amazing-temp-root-for-mediatek-armv8-2020-08-24.3922213/). If you are knowledgable about Smart TV modding/running alternative operating systems, please reach out [here](/en/community/community).
