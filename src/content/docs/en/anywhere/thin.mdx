Thin client images would be fun, and frankly pretty easy.

## Implementation

Very minimal environment with only required packages. OOTB connection protocols (ICA, RDP/VNC, SNMP...) and easy to use installer with connection options built in.

Minimal login screen with an option for branding, might include device management software.

Tools and encouragement for enthusiasts.
