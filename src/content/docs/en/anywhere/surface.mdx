Please review the [Linux Surface wiki page](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki) for your device, there may be further important imformation there regarding additional setup and usage.

## Cameras

All packages and configuration needed to enable (lib)camera support is included. Camera support for some models is still a work in progress upstream. The Surface Pro 7, Intel Surface Laptop 3, and the Surface Book 3 use an IPU4, which is not at all supported at this time. Feature matrix, troubleshooting, and more information can be found [here](https://github.com/linux-surface/linux-surface/wiki/Camera-Support).

#### Notes

- We do not and will **NEVER** support the Surface 1, 2, or RT.
- We do not support the Surface Pro X or Windows DevKit, and probably won't. If you'd like to change this you can [donate hardware](/en/contributing/contributorguide/#hardware).
- We do not support the "Copilot+ PC" Surfaces **YET**.
