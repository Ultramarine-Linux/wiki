We plan on making server images, GUI and CLI. These images will be built for constant runtime, and include/exclude fitting packages for server usecases. If you'd like to suggest a platform, drop us a line in [our chats](/en/community/community).

## Implementation

- Refined OOTB cockpit excperience
- CLI only option
- Advanced installer features
- Advanced networking options
- Package suite more attuned to a server usecase
- Default filesystem changed to ZFS using OpenZFS
- Potential improved RAID and non-RAID architecture implementation...
- Cluster support
- A whole lot more...
