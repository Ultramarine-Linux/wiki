## Using Tow-Boot

Tow-Boot provides an EFI environment, meaning you can boot our ARM Generic ISOs and install normally

## Using Stock u-boot

### Flashing the Image

Start by grabbing [any Preinstalled Image](https://images.fyralabs.com/images/ultramarine/43/) from our website.

Now, you'll need to decompress it.

- On Linux, run `unzstd FILENAME.img.zst`, you may need to install the `zstd` package
- On Windows 11 or ChromeOS, zstd is natively supported. Decompress like you would a `.zip` file.
- On Windows 10, use 7zip or WinRaR
- On macOS, install `zstd` from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (`brew install zstd`), then `unzstd FILENAME.img.zst`.

Grab an SD Card! Use a flasher program to flash Ultramarine to your storage device. [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is an easy cross-platform choice.

If you'd prefer to install it to the internal eMMC or a NVMe drive, you can just reflash from the OS booted off the SD card.

Simply select the .img file, the device you're using, and click flash.

You can also use the Disks application on Budgie, Xfce, and GNOME editions.

### First Boot

On first boot, the root file system will automatically be expanded, and you’ll be prompted with our out-of-box app, [Taidan](/en/setup/installation/#taidan-out-of-box-guide).

That’s it! Ultramarine is on your Pinebook Pro!
