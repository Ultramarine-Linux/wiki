## Creating a User Account

After Ultramarine is installed and you've rebooted into it, you'll be greeted with the out of box experience, Taidan.

You'll be guided through a setup process from here, configure your system as you please.
Welcome to Ultramarine Linux!

## Install NVIDIA Drivers

If you were connected to the Internet during installation NVIDIA drivers were installed automatically.
If this didn't happen or you missed the chance to enable them on first boot, you can install them with these commands:

```bash
sudo dnf update # Update the system first, the drivers may not work if you don't.
sudo dnf install akmod-nvidia # Install the NVIDIA kernel module.
```

Then, reboot your system.

<Alert type="warning">
  You MUST wait until the process is finished before rebooting. Rebooting too
  early might result in a broken driver installation! This may take upwards of
  15 minutes! You can check the progress by running `sudo akmods`
</Alert>

### Use NVIDIA Graphics Card as the primary card on Optimus Laptops

This change is is completely optional. You can skip this step if you don't
want to use your NVIDIA Graphics Card as the primary card, or you do not use a
dual-GPU laptop connected to an external monitor. It may also cause issues
with some applications, such as Steam and Bottles.

Run the following commands to make your NVIDIA Graphics Card the primary Graphics Card:

```bash
sudo cp -p /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf
sudo sed -i '10i\        Option "PrimaryGPU" "yes"' /etc/X11/xorg.conf.d/nvidia.conf # Add PrimaryGPU = yes to the 10th line of the file.
```

Then reboot your system.

## Install Codecs

Ultramarine Linux includes codecs for most of the media you'll come across. **You shouldn't need to install any additional codecs.** Most of these packages below should be installed by default, excluding
the VLC and MPV media players, and the `libdvdcss` library.

However, if you find yourself in the situation where you do not have those codecs (if you converted for example), or require additional codecs other than we have provided (i.e obscure formats, or proprietary codecs not included in any repositories), you can look into the following packages:

- `x264` and `x265` for better H.264 and HEVC video support - Developed by the VideoLAN (VLC) project.
- [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) (`ffmpeg`) - A cross-platform multimedia framework that can manipulate, convert and transcode to and from various media formats.
- [VLC Media Player](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/) (`vlc`) - A free and open-source media player that can play most multimedia files, can also be used to test out the codecs' functionality.
- [MPV](https://mpv.io/) (`mpv`) - A free and open-source media player that can also play most multimedia files. Can be used as a lightweight alternative to VLC.
- [libvpx](https://www.webmproject.org/) (`libvpx`) - A free and open-source codec for VP8 and VP9 video formats.
- [libdvdcss](https://www.videolan.org/developers/libdvdcss.html) (`libdvdcss`) - A library that can be used to read encrypted DVDs. This is not legal in some countries, so please check your local laws before using it. We also do not provide decryption keys for any encrypted DVDs.
- [Opus](https://opus-codec.org/) (`opus`) - A free and open-source audio codec that can be used for both speech and music. Should be installed by default.
- [OpenH264](https://www.openh264.org/) (`openh264`) - A free and open-source codec for H.264 video formats. Should be installed by default, required for WebRTC and partially Firefox.
- [aptX](https://www.aptx.com/) (`pipewire-codec-aptx`) - A proprietary codec for high-quality audio streaming over Bluetooth. Required for wireless Bluetooth audio devices that support it.
- `nv-codec-headers` - NVIDIA's codec headers for encoding and decoding video on NVIDIA GPUs. Required for hardware-accelerated video encoding and decoding on NVIDIA GPUs. May not be used by default assuming you do not have an NVIDIA GPU.
- [LAME](https://lame.sourceforge.io/) (`lame`) - A free and open-source MP3 encoder. Required for encoding MP3 files.
- `PackageKit-gstreamer-plugin` - PackageKit plugin that helps you install the above codec packages using GNOME Software/KDE Discover.

## Set up Backups

You may want to back up your files to an external volume, you can use [Pika Backup] or [Déjà Dup] to do so.

Instructions are available on the [Pika Backup] and [Déjà Dup] websites.

# Advanced Tweaks

These are tweaks that you probably don't care about, if you don't know what you're doing, skip this section.

## Use systemd-boot as the Bootloader

Ultramarine uses GRUB as its bootloader for compatibility reasons. However, if you have a UEFI system, you may switch to
systemd-boot, a modern bootloader. It may even speed up boot!

<Alert type="warning">
  This step is optional. You can skip this step if you don't want to use
  systemd-boot. Make sure to back up your data and have a live USB ready in case
  something goes wrong. Incorrectly configuring a new bootloader can make your
  OS unbootable.
</Alert>

1. Make sure you turn off Secure Boot in your UEFI settings for now, You can re-enable it later after you [sign systemd-boot with your own keys.](#secure-boot-with-systemd-boot)
2. Remove GRUB from protected packages:

```bash
sudo rm /etc/dnf/protected.d/grub*
```

3. Start uninstalling GRUB:

```bash
sudo dnf remove -y grubby grub2\* memtest86\* && sudo rm -rf /boot/grub2 && sudo rm -rf /boot/loader
```

4. Install unsigned systemd-boot binaries and the `sdubby` tool:

```bash
sudo dnf install systemd-boot-unsigned sdubby
```

5. Install systemd-boot to the ESP:

```bash
# Copy your current cmdline options just in case
cat /proc/cmdline | cut -d ' ' -f 2- | sudo tee /etc/kernel/cmdline
# Install systemd-boot
sudo bootctl install
# Now, reinstall and regenerate the current kernel entry
sudo kernel-install add $(uname -r) /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/vmlinuz
# Reinstall the kernel again, just in case we need to trigger some hooks
sudo dnf reinstall -y kernel-core
```

6. Reboot your system and make sure it boots correctly, run `sudo bootctl` to check if the boot process is correct.
7. (Optional) proceed to [Set up Secure Boot](#secure-boot-with-systemd-boot) if you want to re-enable Secure Boot.

### Secure Boot with systemd-boot

If you switch to systemd-boot your bootloader will no longer have Red Hat's signing keys, breaking secure boot. If you'd like to keep using secure boot, you can sign systemd-boot with your own keys.

Fortunately, there's a tool to automate this called sbctl. You can install it from the Terra repository:

```bash
sudo dnf install sbctl
```

After installing `sbctl`, you can use it to enroll, sign, and manage your Secure Boot keys. For example, to generate a new key and enroll it in your UEFI firmware:

```bash
# Generate a new key
sudo sbctl create-keys
# Enroll the key
sudo sbctl enroll-keys
```

You can then use `sbctl sign` to sign your kernel, initramfs, and bootloader binaries. For example:

```bash
# Sign the kernel
sudo sbctl sign /boot/vmlinuz-$(uname -r)
```

However, once you have installed sbctl, it should've already set up a hook to sign the kernel, initramfs and bootloader binaries automatically on kernel updates.

After signing the necessary files and enrolling them in your firmware, you can re-enable Secure Boot in your UEFI settings.

## Using a FIDO2-Compliant Security Key for Decryption

If you [encrypted your setup during installation](/en/setup/installation/#luks-full-disk-encryption), you have the option
of using a FIDO2-Compliant security key (such as a Yubikey 5) to decrypt your disk upon boot.

You'll need to find the encrypted disk name first:

```bash
# Get the list of available block devices
lsblk
```

Find the entry with type `crypt` and mountpoint `/home` or `/`. The disk name should look something like `nvme0n1p3`, `sda3`, or `mmcblk0p2`

Next, enroll your security key with the disk:

```bash
# Enroll security key
sudo systemd-cryptenroll --fido2-device=auto /dev/your_disk_name
```

Replace the disk name with the name found previously. You'll be asked to input the security key PIN and activate the key,
refer to your key's documentation for information on how to do this.

Once the disk has been enrolled, the initramfs must be told to use the security key.

Open the file `/etc/crypttab` in your preferred terminal editor, and after the section labelled `none discard`,
add the line `fido2-device=auto`. It should appear similar to the following:

```bash
# /etc/crypttab
luks-my-disk-id UUID=my-disk-id none discard,fido2-device=auto
```

Lastly, edit the bootloader configuration and specify to use FIDO2. The instructions for this will deviate depending on whether you use systemd-boot or GRUB.

#### GRUB

Edit the file `/etc/default/grub` in your preferred terminal editor.

On the line `GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX`, add the option `rd.luks.fido2-device=auto` before the `rd.luks.uuid` line. An example is provided as follows:

```bash
# /etc/default/grub
GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX="rd.luks.fido2-device=auto rd.luks.uuid=luks-my-disk-id rhgb quiet"
```

#### systemd-boot

Find the loader file. Use `sudo bootctl status` to find all entries. Look for the entry titled "Ultramarine Linux", and note the source entry. It should appear similar to `/boot/efi//loader/entries/id-6.18.5-200.fc43.x86_64.conf` (In general, the format is id-kernel_version.fedora_version.arch.conf). Edit this file in your preferred terminal editor.

On the line `options`, add the option `rd.luks.fido2-device=auto` before the `root=UUID=` line. An example is provided as follows:

```bash
# /boot/efi//loader/entries/*.conf
options    rd.luks.fido2-device=auto root=UUID=id ro ...
```

#### Final Steps

Regenerate the initramfs.

```bash
# Regenerate dracut initramfs
sudo dracut --regenerate-all --force
```

If all went well, reboot the machine. When booting, you should be prompted to enter the PIN for your security key. This may not have any words, just a text box with a lock icon. Enter the PIN and press `Enter`. You will then be asked to activate the security key. Once activated, your drive will be properly decrypted and the boot will finish.
