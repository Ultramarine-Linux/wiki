## System Requirements

If your computer could run Windows 7 well, chances are it'll run Ultramarine Linux. You should check the [System Requirements](/en/hardware/requirements) to make sure

## Choosing Your Edition

Ultramarine Linux comes in 4 variants:

- **Flagship Edition**: Our default and most popular variant. Choose Flagship if you'd like a familiar and stylish experience.
- **KDE Edition**: Our second most popular variant. Choose KDE if you'd like a simply customisable experience.
- **GNOME Edition**: Elegant and Modern. Choose GNOME if you'd like a simple, unique experience.
- **Xfce Edition**: Lightweight and Configurable. Choose Xfce if you'd like a lighter experience.

Check the [System Requirements](/en/hardware/requirements) to make sure your hardware is supported.

Ultramarine Linux is distributed in various formats available for download from [our website](https://ultramarine-linux.org).

  sites other than our website or FOSSTorrents

### Bootc Preview

With Ultramarine 41 we are now providing a developer preview of our bootc variant. Ultramarine bootc is based on Fedora bootc, but we intend to switch to our own base container (based on Fedora packages) in the future.

These builds are not ready for daily use by the average user. If you plan to test them, join our [community](/en/community/community) and keep us posted on any bugs you find, from a small papercut to a broken system.

[Try Ultramarine bootc →](https://github.com/Ultramarine-Linux/bootc)

We previously offered OSTree based builds of Ultramarine Atomic, these are no longer maintained.

### Raw Images and Raspberry Pi

Ultramarine is also available as a raw (or preinstalled) image. These images come with a desktop preinstalled and are intended to be flashed directly to the drive your device will boot from (like an SSD or an SD card.)

These can be found in the [Raw Image](https://images.fyralabs.com/images/ultramarine) sections of the download page.

<Alert type="info">
  If you're using a Raspberry Pi 4, you can skip these steps and use Raspberry
  Pi Imager! Either insert an empty microSD and press shfit at startup, or use
  it on another device.
</Alert>

## Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine Image (Recommended)

Ultramarine images have a matching checksum file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/).

### Verifying the Checksum on Linux and macOS

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the image:

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/checksum # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on Windows

In Powershell, run this command:

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the checksum file with Notepad and compare the checksum
```

<Alert type="info">
  If you're using a Raspberry Pi, stop here and go to the [Raspberry Pi
  instructions](/en/anywhere/rpi)
</Alert>

## Creating the Installer

Grab a USB stick! Use a flasher program to create an installer from the image. [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is an easy cross-platform choice.

You can also use [Fedora Media Writer](https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter), or the Disks application on Flagship, Xfce, and GNOME editions.

<Alert type="info">
  Rufus has been known to cause issues with Ultramarine images.
</Alert>

## Booting the Installer

After flashing the image to your installer, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the installer and restarting your computer.

Most computers have a special key that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the setup screen. This varies from brand to brand, check the [BIOS Keys Page](/en/hardware/bioskeys) for how to enter the boot menu on your machine.

<Alert type="info">
  If you're currently using Windows 10 (or newer) head to the recovery section
  of settings and select "Advanced Restart". Once there, select "Use a Device".
</Alert>

<Alert type="info">
  If you're currently using Linux, you may be able to enter the BIOS by running
  `sudo systemctl reboot --firmware`
</Alert>

## Footnotes

- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Since Fedora 37 the Ultramarine team has maintained Pantheon, in Ultramarine 40 we will be dropping Pantheon due to major issues with the experience.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
