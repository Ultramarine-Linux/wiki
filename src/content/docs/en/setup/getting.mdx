## System Requirements

If your computer could run Windows 7 well, chances are it'll run Ultramarine Linux. You should check the [System Requirements](/en/hardware/requirements) to make sure

## Choosing Your Edition

Ultramarine Linux comes in 4 variants:

- **Plasma Edition**: Our recommended edition for general use and a community favorite with an Ultramarine twist. Simple defaults and wide-ranging customizations.
- **Xfce Edition**: A lightweight and elegant experience designed to help you squeeze the most out of your device, or revive an old one.
- **Budgie Edition**: A familiar and stylish experience with a bit of flair.
- **GNOME Edition**: A simple, elegant, and intuitive desktop with a large ecosystem of apps and extensions.

Check the [System Requirements](/en/hardware/requirements) to make sure your hardware is supported.

Ultramarine Linux is distributed in various formats available for download from [our website](https://ultramarine-linux.org).

  Fyra Labs cannot guarantee the safety or quality of images downloaded from
  sites other than our website or FOSSTorrents
</Alert>

### Microsoft Surface Devices

Ultramarine is available with Microsoft Surface support out of the box.
Downloads can be found on our website, and more information can be found [here](../anywhere/surface).

### Windows Subsystem for Linux

Ultramarine offers a WSL build/application.
This can be found on the microsoft store, with `winget`, or can be installed with an offline script found on it's anywhere page [here](../anywhere/wsl).

### Raw Images and Raspberry Pi

Ultramarine is also available as a raw (or preinstalled) image. These images come with a desktop preinstalled and are intended to be flashed directly to the drive your device will boot from (like an SSD or an SD card.)

These can be found in the [Raw Image](https://images.fyralabs.com/images/ultramarine) sections of the download page.

<Alert type="info">
  If you're using a Raspberry Pi 4, you can skip these steps and use Raspberry
  Pi Imager! Either insert an empty microSD and press shfit at startup, or use
  it on another device.
</Alert>

## Verifying the Safety of an Ultramarine Image (Recommended)

Ultramarine images have a matching checksum file that can be checked against the image itself.

They can be downloaded by clicking the `View checksum` button on the [download page](https://ultramarine-linux.org/download/).

### Verifying the Checksum on Linux and macOS

You can use the following commands to check the integrity of the image:

```bash
sha256sum -b /path/to/ultramarine.iso # Generate the checksum for the image
cat /path/to/checksum # Check the checksum

# Now you can compare the checksum
```

### Verifying the Checksum on Windows

In Powershell, run this command:

```powershell
CertUtil -hashfile PATH\TO\ULTRAMARINE.ISO SHA256
# Open the checksum file with Notepad and compare the checksum
```

<Alert type="info">
  If you're using a Raspberry Pi, stop here and go to the [Raspberry Pi
  instructions](/en/anywhere/rpi)
</Alert>

## Creating the Installer

Grab a USB stick! Use a flasher program to create an installer from the image. [balenaEtcher](https://www.balena.io/etcher/) is an easy cross-platform choice.

You can also use [Fedora Media Writer](https://github.com/FedoraQt/MediaWriter), or the Disks application on Budgie, Xfce, and GNOME editions.

<Alert type="info">
  Rufus has been known to cause issues with Ultramarine images.
</Alert>

## Booting the Installer

After flashing the image to your installer, you can boot to Ultramarine Linux by plugging in the installer and restarting your computer.

Most computers have a special key that can be used to select a boot device, or to enter the setup screen. This varies from brand to brand, check the [BIOS Keys Page](/en/hardware/bioskeys) for how to enter the boot menu on your machine.

<Alert type="info">
  If you're currently using Windows 10 (or newer) head to the recovery section
  of settings and select "Advanced Restart". Once there, select "Use a Device".
</Alert>

<Alert type="info">
  If you're currently using Linux, you may be able to enter the BIOS by running
  `sudo systemctl reboot --firmware`
</Alert>

## Footnotes

- The Anaconda installer is very complex and hard to work with, we are working on a new installer that is easier to use and more reliable.
- Ultramarine's Budgie edition provides a close to stock Budgie experience, with a custom theme. Unlike Fedora's Budgie Spin, which provides a completely custom layout and experience.
