import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

If you are using an Anaconda image, proceed with the instructions below. If you are using a Readymade Preview image, go [here](#readymade). If installing to a Chromebook, go [here](/en/chromebook/installing).

# Anaconda

After booting into the live system, you will see a dialog box asking you whether to start the installer or continue with the live system.

![The Welcome Dialog box](/assets/welcome-window.png)

You can pick whichever you want, and you'll be able to start the installer later by opening the `Install to Hard Drive` application.

## Language Selection

![The Language Selection Screen](/assets/anaconda-1.png)

After starting the installer, you will be greeted with a language selection screen. Simply choose the language and keyboard layout you would like to use.

## The Anaconda Hub & Spoke Model

![Anaconda Hub](/assets/anaconda-2.png)

Anaconda uses a hub and spoke model. You can configure your installation in any order you want, but you will need to complete all the options before you can continue.

### Keyboard Layouts

![Anaconda Keyboard Layout](/assets/anaconda-3.png)

Press the `+` button to add a new keyboard layout, then pick and search for the keyboard layout you prefer.

Once you have selected the keyboard layout, you can press the `Done` button on the top left to go back to the hub.

### Time & Date

![](/assets/anaconda-4.png)

The Time & Date selection screen has a world map where you can click on your location on the map to set your timezone.

<Alert type="info">

By default, the time is set from your IP address geolocation. If you're using a VPN or proxy this may not be accurate.

</Alert>

### Storage

![](/assets/anaconda-5.png)

This is where you select where you want Ultramarine to be installed, you can have the installer automatically partition your disk, or, select a custom layout.

By default, Ultramarine uses [Btrfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Btrfs) on standard computers.

<Alert type="info">
  We recommend encrypting your disk for added security. Simply select the
  "Encrypt" checkbox, you will be prompted to enter a new password after
  pressing done, and the password you provided to the installer on every boot.
</Alert>

#### Custom Partitioning

![](/assets/anaconda-6.png)

In this mode, you can have Anaconda automatically setup partitions for you, or, manually configure the layout of the disk.

On UEFI-based systems, you need a partition mounted as `/boot/EFI` and another mounted as `/`.

On BIOS-based systems, you need a `BIOSBoot` partition, a partition mounted as `/boot` and another mounted as `/`.

#### Advanced Partitioning

![](/assets/anaconda-7.png)

In this mode, Anaconda uses a tool called blivet-gui for you to manually partition your drive. This mode provides more freedom, so make sure you know what you're doing.

### Networking

![](/assets/anaconda-8.png)

On this screen, you can configure the hostname for the installed system. This is what other computers will call your device.

### User Accounts

![](/assets/anaconda-9.png)

In this screen, you must set up a user account. This account will be the administrator for the installed system.

You can also click on the `Advanced` button for a more in-depth configuration of your account, such as your user folder location, account ID, and group membership.

<Alert type="warning">

You must enter a password. Applications may misbehave without one.

</Alert>

<Alert type="info">

If you type in an insecure password, you must press the `Done` button twice to continue.

</Alert>

After completing your system configuration, press the `Begin Installation` button to continue. The installation process will start and may take a few minutes.

<Alert type="danger">
  This process is **IRREVERSIBLE**. If you manage to stop the installer before
  it finishes, you will end up with a broken system. <br /> To fix this, you
  will have to reinstall Ultramarine Linux or your preferred operating system.
</Alert>

After the installation process is complete, Anaconda will prompt you to reboot your device, simply reboot and enjoy!

Welcome to Ultramarine Linux!

# Readymade

After booting into the live system, you will see an icon on the desktop labeled "install to Computer." Open this to launch the Readymade installer, or continue with the live system.

## Language Selection

![The Language Selection Screen](/assets/readymade/language.png)

Before we get started, select your preferred language.

## Welcome Screen

![The Welcome Dialog box](/assets/readymade/install-or-try.png)

From here you can select `Try` to continue using the live system, or `Install` to proceed with installation.

## Install Destination

![Destination Selection](/assets/readymade/devices.png)

On the Destination page, select the device you would like to install to. Make sure you select the correct device, since after installation the data on the selected device will be wiped.

## Installation Type

![Installation type](/assets/readymade/install-type.png)

From here, you have the option to install to the entire disk, or customize your install.

You also have the option to encrypt your disk, and enable TPM encryption. When you encrypt your disk, you will be prompted to enter a password used for encryption. Note that this is in no way tied to your Ultramarine user password.

For more information on how encryption works, refer [here](#encryption).

## Custom Installation

![custom](/assets/readymade/install-custom-mountpoint.png)

In this mode, you can manually configure the layout of the disk.

On UEFI-based systems, you need a partition mounted as `/boot/EFI` and another mounted as `/`.

On BIOS-based systems, you need a `BIOSBoot` partition, a partition mounted as `/boot` and another mounted as `/`.

# Confirmation

![Confirmation](/assets/readymade/confirm.png)

Now, you are ready to install. Select `Install` to begin. You will then be taken to the page below, with links to out wiki, chats, and contribution information that will open in the live environment during the install.

# Encryption

FDE (full-disk encryption) is a method in which all data on a disk is made unreadable (encrypted), and can be decrypted with a matching authentication key. This authentication key can be unlocked using a password, hardware security key, TPM, biometrics, etc. This means that if the drive was removed and placed into another computer, the data would still be unreadable without one of these unlock methods.

BitLocker is common on Windows systems, FileVault is common on macOS systems, and LUKS is common on Linux systems. When using enabling disk encryption when installing Ultramarine Linux, you are using LUKS.

## LUKS Full-Disk Encryption

LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), specifically LUKS2, is the standard disk encryption method on many Linux systems.

LUKS uses a multi-layered encryption approach, meaning that when you use LUKS encryption, you enter a passphrase that is then used to unlock the master key, which is stored in the LUKS partition header. This master key is then used to unlock the partition's encrypted data. You will loose access to your data if the header is overwritten, or the password is forgotten.

### TPM backed LUKS Full-Disk Encryption

What a TPM is and how it works is beyond the scope for this wiki, refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) for more information regarding TPMs.

TPM encryption can be enabled in Readymade by selecting `Enable TPM` after selecting `Enable disk encryption`. Please note a TPM 2.0 is required for using TPM backed FDE in Readymade.

TPM backed full-disk encryption replaces your LUKS password entry step by storing the decryption key (to the master key stored in the LUKS partition header) in the TPM instead. Here are some reasons this could be useful to you:

- The TPM can detect malicious system changes, helping to prevent [evil maid attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack), among other vulnerabilities.
- TPM backed FDE is also useful in preventing LUKS passphrase brute-forcing in the case of drive theft, as the only way to decrypt the master key is using the TPM associated with the drive (and it is much, much more difficult to crack the mastery key).
- When using a TPM, you are also safe from keylogging and memory extraction attacks.

There can also be drawbacks to using TPM as well. Here are some reasons this could not be useful to you:

- TPM/motherboard failure can prevent data recovery. If this is a concern, we reccomend creating a backup key.
- If an entire computer is stolen, the encryption will still auto-decrypt itself, leaving a system with essentailly user passphrase security only, which can be bypassed and broken.
