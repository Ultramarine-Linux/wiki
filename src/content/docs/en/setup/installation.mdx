import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

If you are using an Anaconda image, proceed with the instructions below. If you are using a Readymade Preview image, go [here](#readymade).

![The Welcome Dialog box](/assets/welcome-window.png)

You can pick whichever you want, and you'll be able to start the installer later by opening the `Install to Hard Drive`/`Install to Device` application.

## Anaconda

After booting into the live system, you will see a dialog box asking you whether to start the installer or continue with the live system (note, depending on the edition, this dialog box may look different then the screenshot below).

### Language Selection

![The Language Selection Screen](/assets/anaconda-1.png)

After starting the installer, you will be greeted with a language and keyboard selection screen. Simply choose the language and keyboard layout you would like to use.

### Installation Method

![Installation Method](/assets/anaconda-2.png)

Verify your destination drive and install method is correct.

![Storage Configuration](/assets/anaconda-3.png)

Configure your storage. You also have the option to encrypt your disk. When you encrypt your disk, you will be prompted to enter a password used for encryption. Note that this is in no way tied to your Ultramarine user password.

If you want to set up a custom storage config, select the 3-dot menu on the top right, then select `Launch Storage Editor`.

<Alert type="info">
  We recommend encrypting your disk for added security. Simply select the
  "Encrypt" checkbox, you will be prompted to enter a new password after
  pressing done, and the password you provided to the installer on every boot.
</Alert>

For more information on how encryption works, refer [here](#encryption).

After completing your system configuration, press the `Erase data and Install` button to continue. The installation process will start and may take a few minutes.

<Alert type="danger">
  This process is **IRREVERSIBLE**. If you manage to stop the installer before
  it finishes, you will end up with a broken system. <br /> To fix this, you
  will have to reinstall.
</Alert>

After the installation process is complete, Anaconda will prompt you to exit. You can reboot your device from the live environment.

Next you'll set up your system.

## Readymade

After booting into the live system, you will see an icon on the desktop labeled `Install to Device`. Open this to launch the Readymade installer.

### Language Selection

![The Language Selection Screen](/assets/readymade/language.png)

First, select your preferred language.

### Welcome Screen

![The Welcome Dialog box](/assets/readymade/install-or-try.png)

From here you can select `Try` to continue using the live system, or `Install` to proceed with installation.

### Install Destination

![Destination Selection](/assets/readymade/devices.png)

Select the device you would like to install to. Make sure you select the correct device, since after installation the data on the selected device will be wiped.

### Installation Type

![Installation type](/assets/readymade/install-type.png)

From here, select `Entire Disk`. Note that a custom option will come in future releases.

You also have the option to encrypt your disk, and enable TPM encryption. When you encrypt your disk, you will be prompted to enter a password used for encryption. Note that this is in no way tied to your Ultramarine user password.

<Alert type="info">
  We recommend encrypting your disk for added security. Simply select the
  "Encrypt" checkbox, you will be prompted to enter a new password after
  pressing done, and the password you provided to the installer on every boot.
</Alert>

For more information on how encryption works, refer [here](#encryption).

### Confirmation

![Confirmation](/assets/readymade/confirm.png)

Now, you are ready to install. Select `Install` to begin. You will then be taken to the page below, with links to out wiki, chats, and contribution information that will open in the live environment during the install.

### Installing

![Installing](/assets/readymade/installing.png)

<Alert type="danger">
  This process is **IRREVERSIBLE**. If you manage to stop the installer before
  it finishes, you will end up with a broken system. <br /> To fix this, you
  will have to reinstall.
</Alert>

After the installation process is complete, Readymade will prompt you to reboot your device, simply reboot and enjoy!

Welcome to Ultramarine Linux!

## Encryption

FDE (full-disk encryption) is a method in which all data on a disk is made unreadable (encrypted) without first trying to be read with a matching authentication key.
- In Anaconda, This authentication key can be unlocked using a passphrase. This means that if the drive was removed and placed into another computer, the data would still be unreadable until the passphrase is entered.
- In Readymade, This authentication key can be unlocked using a passphrase or a devices TPM2. This means that if the drive was removed and placed into another computer, the data would still be unreadable until the passphrase is entered, and if using TPM2, the data will be unreadable.

BitLocker is common on Windows systems, FileVault is common on macOS systems, and LUKS is common on Linux systems. When enabling disk encryption when installing Ultramarine Linux, you are using LUKS.

### LUKS Full-Disk Encryption

LUKS (Linux Unified Key Setup), specifically LUKS2, is the standard disk encryption method on many Linux systems.

LUKS uses a multi-layered encryption approach, meaning that when you use LUKS encryption, you enter a passphrase that is then used to unlock the master key, which is stored in the LUKS partition header. This master key is then used to unlock the partition's encrypted data. You will loose access to your data if the header is overwritten, or the password is forgotten.

### TPM backed LUKS Full-Disk Encryption

What a TPM is and how it works is beyond the scope for this wiki, refer [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_Platform_Module) if you're interested.

TPM encryption can be enabled in Readymade by selecting `Enable TPM` after selecting `Enable disk encryption`. Please note a TPM 2.0 is required for using TPM backed FDE in Readymade.

TPM backed full-disk encryption replaces your LUKS password entry step by storing the decryption key (to the master key stored in the LUKS partition header) in the TPM instead. Here are some reasons this could be useful to you:

- The TPM can detect malicious system changes, helping to prevent [evil maid attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Evil_maid_attack), among other vulnerabilities.
- TPM backed FDE is also useful in preventing LUKS passphrase brute-forcing in the case of drive theft, as the only way to decrypt the master key is using the TPM associated with the drive (and it is much, much more difficult to crack the mastery key).
- When using a TPM, you are also safe from keylogging and memory extraction attacks.

There can also be drawbacks to using TPM as well. Here are some reasons this could not be useful to you:

- TPM/motherboard failure can prevent data recovery. If this is a concern, we reccomend creating a backup key.
- If an entire computer is stolen, the encryption will still auto-decrypt itself, leaving a system with essentailly user passphrase security only, which can be bypassed and broken.
