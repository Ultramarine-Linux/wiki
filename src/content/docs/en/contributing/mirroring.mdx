title: Mirroring
description: "A guide of how you can mirror Ultramarine Linux, making downloads faster for everyone"
---

Mirroring allows you to contribute to the Ultramarine Linux ecosystem by hosting packages closer to users, making downloads faster, more reliable, and reducing load on Fyra Labs' core infrastructure.

When users update or install packages, they'll hit our mirror director service, [Tetsudou](https://github.com/terrapkg/tetsudou), which will calculate an optimal set of mirrors to download updates from, possibly including yours.

## Requirements

- A publicly accessible server with good uptime
- A domain name
- A good internet connection (1Gbps or more)
- A moderate amount of disk space (100GB or more)
- Experience with server administration

## Mirroring using Terra Mirror Scripts

We provide a mirror script (and accessory Docker image) to help you get started. Documentation is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/terrapkg/mirror-script).

## Mirroring using rsync

You can also mirror the repositories using the `rsync-ssl` utility.

```sh
rsync-ssl -avPzr --delete rsync://repos.fyralabs.com/repo/ /path/to/your/mirror
```

## Running on a schedule

Regardless of whether you're using the mirror script or directly calling rsync, you'll need to run them on a schedule to keep your mirror up-to-date. We recommend schedudling for every 5 minutes.

This is required if you want to submit your mirror to the public list. We may remove mirrors that are not kept up-to-date.

You can use any method for this, but we recommend systemd timers. A good guide on how to set up a systemd timer can be found [here](https://opensource.com/article/20/7/systemd-timers).

## Serving your mirror

All mirrors must be served over HTTPS. You can use a web server of your choosing to serve your mirror, we recommend using [Static Web Server](https://static-web-server.net/) or [Caddy](https://caddyserver.com/).

## Submitting your mirror

Once you have your mirror set up, you can submit it to the public mirror list by opening a pull request on the [Tetsudou repository](https://github.com/terrapkg/tetsudou).

The public mirror configuration is stored in the `repos/` directory. Each JSON file represents a repository that can be mirrored. You can add your mirror in the appropriate JSON files.
If you're mirroring all repositories, the default, you ned to add your mirror to all JSON files.

Here is an example of an entry:

```json
{
  "url": "repos.fyralabs.com/terra41",
  "asn": 24940,
  "continent": "EU",
  "country": "DE",
  "lat": 50.5597,
  "lon": 6.7705,
  "protocols": ["https"]
}
```

And here is a table of what each field means:
| Field | Meaning | Example |
| ------- | ------------ | ------- |
| url | The URL of your mirror, do not include the protocol. | `repos.fyralabs.com/terra41` |
| asn | Your Autonomous System Number (ASN). | `24940` |
| continent | The shortcode of the continent your mirror is located on. | `EU` |
| country | The shortcode of the country your mirror is located in. | `DE` |
| lat | The latitude of your mirror. | `50.5597` |
| lon | The longitude of your mirror. | `6.7705` |
| protocols | The protocols your mirror supports, only `https` is supported. | `["https"]` |

### Notes

- You can use a service like [ipinfo.io](https://ipinfo.io/) to get your ASN, continent, country, latitute, and longitude from your server's IP address.
- The location doesn't have to be exact, but it should be close to your actual location.
