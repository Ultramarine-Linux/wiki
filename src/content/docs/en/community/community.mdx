Ultramarine Linux has an active community of users, tinkerers, developers, and everyone in between.

Our community (like our code) is open to everyone. Here's some of the official spaces:

### Discord

The Fyra Labs Discord is for all of our projects. We have lively discussions and build great things together. You can get support as a user and as a contributor here.

### Matrix

<Alert type="info">
We're closing our Matrix rooms due to a myriad of issues. [Learn more here →](https://blog.fyralabs.com/dropping-matrix/)

</Alert>

### Socials

Ultramarine Linux is on the Fediverse, Bluesky, and Twitter. These accounts will include important updates about features, bugs, and downtime.

### Reddit

The Ultramarine Subreddit is a more asynchronous way to interact with the community. It offers the same great things in a more reddit-y way.

## Our Philosophy

We believe that the Fyra Community is larger than just Fyra (the organization). Part of this is interacting with the rest of our community. We feel that this allows us to better judge the desires and needs of our users (and we love talking to all of you).
