## Mandatory Access Controls

Ultramarine Linux uses SELinux, a software that implements Mandatory Access Control. This prevents applications (and users) from accessing files they shouldn't be able to.

Users will usually be required to have root access to modify system files, and even then, SELinux may prevent you from doing so unless you have set the correct contexts for the files.

By default, SELinux is in "Enforcing" mode, which means that it will prevent you from modifying system files unless you have the correct permissions. This shouldn't cause any issues. If you would like to disable SELinux you can run`sudo setenforce 0`. We don't recommend this as it makes your system less secure.

## Privilege Control

Ultramarine Linux includes polkit, a tool used to manage privilege elevation. If you've ever gotten a graphical password prompt on your system, you've interacted with polkit.

<Alert type="info">

Use the `pkexec` command instead of `sudo` to give polkit a try.

</Alert>

polkit also manages communication between privileged and non privileged applications.
