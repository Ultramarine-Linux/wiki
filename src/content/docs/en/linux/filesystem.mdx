The Linux (and UNIX) file system is a hierarchical structure of files and directories that make up a Linux operating system.

In Linux, everything is a file. Unlike Windows where there are many other object types that can either be a physical device, and inter-process communication is done by a kernel call.

## The File System Hierarchy

The file system hierarchy is a set of directories that appear under the root directory `/`. They not only contain normal files, but also physical devices, virtual devices, and various other special files that control the system itself.

The directory structure is as follows:

| Directory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /         | The root directory, contains the all the other directories and files.                                                                                                                                       |
| /bin      | Contains executables and command binares that are required for the system to function.                                                                                                                      |

| /dev      | Contains special device files that can be used for special purposes (`/dev/sda` for a SATA drive, `/dev/null` for blank data, `/dev/random` for pseudo-random data, `/dev/tty` for terminal sessions, etc). |
| /etc      | Contains system-wide settings and configuration files.                                                                                                                                                      |

## The Home Directory

The home folder is the place where all your personal data is stored. It is a directory that is located under the `/home` directory, followed by the username. It is similar to the `Users` folder in Windows.

In Linux, the home folder is usually more extensively used than in Windows, as it stores all user-specific data and app settings. The system folders are only used when one wants to make system-wide changes.

<Alert type="warning">
  If an app you don't know asks you for your password or root access, It may be
  trying to compromise your system. Cases like this are usually uncommon on
  Linux, but you should be aware of it.
</Alert>

## Security

Ultramarine Linux uses SELinux, software that implements Mandatory Access Control. This prevents applications (and users) from accessing files they shouldn't be able to.

Users will usually be required to have root access to modify system files, and even then, SELinux may prevent you from doing so unless you have set the correct contexts for the files.

By default, SELinux is in "Enforcing" mode, which means that it will prevent you from modifying system files unless you have the correct permissions. This shouldn't cause any issues. If you would like to disable SELinux you can run`sudo setenforce 0`. We don't recommend this as it makes your system less secure.

## Virtual Memory

[Virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) is a feature in Linux and other operating systems that allows the system to use a portion of the disk as RAM. This is useful when the system runs out of RAM and needs to use the disk as a temporary storage for data.

On Windows, this is called a "Page file", and on Linux, it is called a "Swap file". The swap file is usually located at `/swapfile` or as a dedicated partition on the disk.

Swap comes with many issues, for example, it can reduce the lifespan of lower-cost SSDs, and may be too slow on hard drives. To combat this Ultramarine uuses memory compression [(zram specifically)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram).

By default, we match the amount of physical memory you have. (Which is the maximum)

Although this may sound magical, it does come at the cost of your CPU working a little bit harder. Luckily this is not very noticeable on modern computers.

## File system formats

Ultramarine Linux supports a wide variety of file systems, and can be configured to use any of them during installation.

It currently supports most file systems that are supported by the Linux kernel, including:

- ext2, ext3, ext4
- BTRFS
- XFS
- NTFS
- FAT32

And extra file system drivers can be installed, such as:

- exFAT
- ZFS

The Ultramarine Linux installer will be configured to use the BTRFS file system by default, as it is the most modern file system that is supported by the Linux kernel, and has many features that are useful for desktop users, such as snapshots, virtual volumes, journalling, error correction and compression.

By default, it will use up all the available space on the disk save for a small amount of space for the EFI bootloader partition, and create a BTRFS JBOD array using all the available space on all selected disks.
And then create 2 subvolumes, one for the root directory `/`, and one for the home directory `/home`, which will share the same space but have different filesystem settings.

So unless specified otherwise, the installer will use all your disks to create a JBOD (spanned) array, which may be undesirable if you do not want to risk losing all your data if one of the disks fail.

Most server installations will use XFS or ZFS, as they have better performance and reliability for servers, and are more suitable for RAID arrays.

### Remote Filesystems

Ultramarine Linux can also mount remote file systems from a remote server or NAS, using the NFS, (S)FTP, SMB, and WebDAV protocols.
