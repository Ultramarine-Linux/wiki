The Linux (and UNIX) file system is a hierarchical structure of files and directories that make up a Linux operating system.

In Linux, everything is a file. Unlike Windows where there are many other object types that can either be a physical device, and inter-process communication is done by a kernel call.

## The File System Hierarchy

The file system hierarchy is a set of directories that appear under the root directory `/`. They not only contain normal files, but also physical devices, virtual devices, and various other special files that control the system itself.

The directory structure is as follows:

| Directory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| :-------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /         | The root directory, contains the all the other directories and files.                                                                                                                                       |
| /bin      | Contains executables and command binares that are required for the system to function.                                                                                                                      |
| /boot     | The Boot loader, this may usually be in a seperate partition.                                                                                                                                               |
| /dev      | Contains special device files that can be used for special purposes (`/dev/sda` for a SATA drive, `/dev/null` for blank data, `/dev/random` for pseudo-random data, `/dev/tty` for terminal sessions, etc). |
| /etc      | Contains system-wide settings and configuration files.                                                                                                                                                      |

| /lib      | Libraries required for executables in `/bin` to function. May be also named `/lib<arch>` for multi-architecture support.                                                                                    |

## The Home Directory

The home folder is the place where all your personal data is stored. It is a directory that is located under the `/home` directory, followed by the username. It is similar to the `Users` folder in Windows.

In Linux, the home folder is usually more extensively used than in Windows, as it stores all user-specific data and app settings. The system folders are only used when one wants to make system-wide changes.

<Alert type="warning">
  If an app you don't know asks you for your password or root access, It may be
  trying to compromise your system. Cases like this are usually uncommon on
  Linux, but you should be aware of it.
</Alert>

## Security

In Fedora and Ultramarine Linux specifically, system-critical files usually have an extra layer of protection using SELinux, a MAC (Mandatory Access Control) system that is used to prevent unauthorized access to system files, invented by the NSA.

Users will usually be required to have root access to modify these files, and even then, SELinux may prevent you from doing so unless you have set the correct contexts for the files.

Ultramarine Linux comes with SELinux set in "Enforcing" mode, which means that it will prevent you from modifying system files unless you have the correct permissions for security reasons. However this may cause issues with some apps, so you can set it to "Permissive" mode by running `sudo setenforce 0` in the terminal.

## Virtual Memory

[Virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) is a feature in Linux and other operating systems that allows the system to use a portion of the hard drive as RAM. This is useful when the system runs out of RAM, and needs to use the hard drive as a temporary storage for data.

On Windows, this is called a "Page file", and on Linux, it is called a "Swap file". The swap file is usually located at `/swapfile` or as a dedicated partition on the hard drive.

On Ultramarine Linux however, the swap file is replaced by a special kernel feature called [zram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram), which works as a compressed RAM disk.
This is useful for systems with small amounts of RAM, as it essentially allows the system to squeeze more memory out of the existing RAM at the cost of more CPU overhead.

However, zram is not a full replacement for swap, as it is still limited by the amount of RAM available. If you have a system with 4GB of RAM, and you are running a memory-intensive application, you may still need to use a swap file, or consider upgrading your RAM.

And additionally, virtual memory is much slower than physical RAM, as RAM modules are designed to be much faster than hard drives. So you may experience slowdowns when using virtual memory, especially if you are using a hard drive instead of an SSD.
Or even expect shorter lifespans for your SSD, as SSDs have a limited number of write cycles and may wear out faster if you use virtual memory.

We recommend at least 8GB of RAM for a smooth experience on Ultramarine Linux, especially on GNOME and KDE Plasma editions.

## File system formats

Ultramarine Linux supports a wide variety of file systems, and can be configured to use any of them during installation.

It currently supports most file systems that are supported by the Linux kernel, including:

- ext2, ext3, ext4
- BTRFS
- XFS
- NTFS
- FAT32

And extra file system drivers can be installed, such as:

- exFAT
- ZFS

The Ultramarine Linux installer will be configured to use the BTRFS file system by default, as it is the most modern file system that is supported by the Linux kernel, and has many features that are useful for desktop users, such as snapshots, virtual volumes, journalling, error correction and compression.

By default, it will use up all the available space on the disk save for a small amount of space for the EFI bootloader partition, and create a BTRFS JBOD array using all the available space on all selected disks.
And then create 2 subvolumes, one for the root directory `/`, and one for the home directory `/home`, which will share the same space but have different filesystem settings.

So unless specified otherwise, the installer will use all your disks to create a JBOD (spanned) array, which may be undesirable if you do not want to risk losing all your data if one of the disks fail.

Most server installations will use XFS or ZFS, as they have better performance and reliability for servers, and are more suitable for RAID arrays.

### Remote file systems

Ultramarine Linux can also mount remote file systems from a remote server or NAS, using the NFS, (S)FTP, SMB, and WebDAV protocols.
