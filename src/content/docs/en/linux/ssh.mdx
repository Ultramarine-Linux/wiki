Secure Shell ("SSH") is one of the most common utilities when access to a remote device is needed. It's encrypted, powerful, and simple to understand.

## SSH overview
SSH uses a client/server model where one computer acts as an SSH server[^1] and allows other computers to connect.

## Connecting to an SSH Server
To access a device remotely, the `ssh` command is run from [the shell](/en/linux/shell), mostly used with this format:

```zsh
ssh [username@]<server url>
```
If you don't specify a username then SSH will attempt to connect you using the username with which you are logged in. Here are some examples:
- `ssh myuser@myserver.com`
    - This will attempt to connect to the server at myserver.com using the username myuser
- `ssh myuser@192.168.1.2`
    - This is just like the example above except you can also specify an IP address instead of a hostname
- `ssh myserver.com`
    - This will attempt to connect to the SSH server at myserver.com using your current username

When using any of the above commands, once connected to the remote server you'll be prompted for a password.

## Running Your Own SSH Server
Most modern Linux distros come with the required software to host your own SSH server. To allow users to connect to your machine, start the SSH server application using
```zsh
sudo systemctl start sshd
```
Note that the above command uses `sudo`. The `sudo` command will execute the following commands as root (the superuser). For many commands that involve starting and stopping servers, the permission of the system's superuser is necessary. You can read more about the `sudo` command [here](en/linux/permissions). The above command also uses the `systemctl` command. This command is mostly used to manage servers or other Linux services.

Once the above command is run, your machine will begin listening for incoming connections on port 22. You can verify that the SSH server application started correctly by using the command
```zsh
systemctl status sshd
```

You should see output similar to this:

```zsh

```

Check for the field that says `Active: active (running)` to ensure that the SSH server is listening for incoming connections.

If you'd like to stop the SSH server, you can do so with
```zsh
sudo systemctl stop sshd
```

You should see output similar to this:
```zsh

[^1]### A Note about the Word "Server"
It's common to hear the word "server" used but not understand exactly what is meant. Here are a couple examples of how "server" can be used:

- It can refer to a physical machine somewhere
    - Ex: Our email server lost power over the weekend.
- It can refer to a specific *application* running on one machine (or even a number of machines across the world!)
    - Ex: The SSH server is up so that users can connect.

In this guide we'll try to make it clear to which we're referring.
