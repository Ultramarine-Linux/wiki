The shell is a command line interface to the operating system. It is a program that allows you to directly execute commands and interact on deeper level.

You may be familar with Bash from other Linux distributions. Ultramarine uses the [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell) instead of bash. We also use [Starship Prompt](https://starship.rs/) to provide additional convenience features like displaying the current git branch.

    NOTE: The Z shell is mostly compatible with Bash, so most of the knowledge you
    will learn will be mostly applicable in Ultramarine Linux.

## Interacting with the Shell

To start using the shell, open the Terminal app.

![The GNOME Terminal](/assets/terminal.png)

You will be greeted with a prompt, simply type in the command you want to execute, and press `Enter⏎`.

To change directories, type `cd` followed by the path you want to change to.

```zsh
cd /home/user/Documents
```

To list the contents of a directory, type `ls` followed by the path of the directory of which you want to list the contents of.

```zsh
ls /home/user/documents
```

The directory path is an optional argument. Running `ls` with no arguments will print the contents of the current working directory (the folder you `cd`ed into).

The `ls` command, especially, has a lot of useful flags (i.e. execute  `ls -a`, `-a` being the flag). Below is a table of the most important flags for `ls`.

| Flag | Modification                                                                    |
| :--- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `-a` | List all files in the directory, including hidden files which begin with a `.`. |
| `-d` | List specified director(y\|ies) without listing it's contents, (try `ls -d /`). |
| `-t` | Sort the output in the order of modification time; latest first.                |
| `-r` | Sort output in reverse order.                                                   |
| `-l` | List one file per line. Also displays information about the files listed.       |

The output of `ls -l` includes information on the file type, target, read-only (boolean), permissions, number of symlinks, number of inodes, and states the owner of the file, in that order.
```
total 4
drwxr-xr-x    2 bob bob      4096 Jan 1 13:00 dir
-rw-r--r--    1 bob bob         0 Jan 1 12:00 file
-rwxrwxrwx    1 ann ann      1337 Jan 1 11:00 file2
```

Symbolic links (symlinks) are, as the name would imply, links between files. Changes to files are synced between symlinks. To create a symlink between two files, type `ln`, followed by the `-s` flag and two arguments: one being the original file, and the other being the path to the new symlink.

```zsh
ln -s file newfile
```
From now on, when `file` is changed, the change will also be applied to the linked `newfile`.

To read a file to the terminal, type `cat` followed by the path to the file.

```zsh
cat /home/user/Documents/README.md
```

To delete a file, type `rm` followed by the path to the file.

```zsh
rm /home/user/Documents/README.md
```

To delete a full directory, recursively delete it by typing `rm -r` followed by the path to the directory.

```zsh
rm -r /home/user/Documents
```

<Alert type="info">
  Most users will usually execute `rm -rf` instead of `rm -r`. The `-f` flag is
  used to force the deletion of a file or directory.
</Alert>

To create a new file, type `touch` followed by the path to the file.

```zsh
touch /home/user/Documents/newfile.txt
```

To create a new directory, type `mkdir` followed by the path to the directory.

```zsh
mkdir /home/user/Documents/newdir
```

<Alert type="info">
  To create a new directory inside of another new directory (i.e. `.../newdir/newdir2`), execute `mkdir` with the `-p` flag.
</Alert>

To move or rename a file or directory, type `mv` followed by the path to the file or directory, and then the new path.

```zsh
mv /home/user/Documents/newfile.txt /home/user/Documents/newfile2.txt
```

To copy a file and optionally rename the copy, type `cp` followed by the path of the file, and then the path to the new file.

```zsh
cp file newfile
``

<Alert type="info">
  To copy a directory, type `cp` with the `-r` (recursive) flag.
</Alert>

For both the `cp` and `mv` commands, you may move multiple files into a directory at once. The target directory must exist.

```zsh
mv file file2 dir dir2 /path/to/target/dir/
cp -r file file2 dir dir2 /path/to/target/dir/
```

To know more about each command, open the manual by typing `man` followed by what you want to learn about

```
man sudo
```

This will open `less`, an app that allows you to read through long lines of text as a scrollable page.

To exit `less` press `q`.

Most commands will also have a `-h` or `--help` flag, which tells you more about the command.

## The Pipeline

Linux offers a way for inter-process communication through pipes.

The pipeline you to transfer data from one process to another, and is used to execute commands in parallel.

```zsh
echo "Hello World" | wc -w
```

This calls the `wc` (word count) command, which counts the number of words in the text. Then pipes the output of `echo` to it, which then outputs the number of words. This is a very simple example of a pipeline.

A named pipe is created by using `>` instead of `|`.

```zsh
echo "Hello World" > pipe.txt
```

This pipes the output of `echo` to the named pipe `pipe.txt`, which is now a file.

## Executing a File

To execute a program, you must first make sure that the file is executable. This is done by using the `chmod` command.

```bash
chmod +x /path/to/exec
```

Then you can execute the file by directly pointing to it.

```bash
/path/to/exec
```

For files in your current folder, you must use `./` before the file name.

```bash
./exec
```

<Alert type="info">
  When executables are moved to a `$PATH` directory such as `/usr/local/bin/`, the filenames can be executed as commands.
