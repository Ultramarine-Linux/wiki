Linux refers to a family of operating systems with one common feature: the Linux kernel.

Linux is distributed uniquely compared to Windows or macOS. Multiple (seperate) groups take the Linux kernel and combine it with tons of other software before distrbuting it as a distinct operating system. These compilations are called "distributions" (but we'll shorten that to distro.)

Ultramarine Linux is based on another disribution of Linux called Fedora. See ["Why does this distro exist?"](/en/welcome#why-does-this-distro-exist-what-difference-does-it-have-other-than-just-fedora-with-rpmfusion) for more on that.

## Why use Linux?

People use Linux on the desktop for all sorts of reasons. For our purposes, we'll split this into four categories: Customization, Freedom, Security, Privacy.

### Customization

Linux is incredibly customizable. You can change anything from the way your desktop icons look to the way apps load and the behavior of the device itself. Ultramarine provides easy ways to do this, like theme support, power management profiles (in most editions) and the upcoming tweak tool.

### Freedom

When we say freedom, we mean it in two ways. This is often described as "free as in beer" V.S. "free as in speech". Linux will cost you no money, and will allow you to do essentially whatever you'd like.

For example: Edge cannot be removed from a Windows computer. Meanwhile on Linux, there is no such limitation. Essential apps like the file manager can be exchanged for one of many alternatives. Complete freedom.

### Security

Linux is more secure by design, with features like Mandatory Access Controls and stricter permissions, you can learn more about those features on the [Permissions](/en/linux/permissions) page.

Linux is also resistant to many common viruses due to these features (and inexperienced developers.) This is becoming less true as Linux marketshare grows, but you are significantly less likely to get an incidental virus on Linux than Windows.

### Privacy

It's no secret that the big three of operating systems are watching what you do in some way. Linux vendors tend not to do this, and even if they do, you can easily switch to a compatible alternative or simply disable the telemetry.

## How is Ultramarine Different?

Ultramarine Linux is designed to get a lot of the configuration out of the way. We include extra components (like media codecs and drivers) that many other distrbutions don't include.

Ultramarine is built on Fedora, the base for Red Hat's Enterprise Linux. This means that the software backing Ultramarine has been built with the stability needed for mission critical systems.
