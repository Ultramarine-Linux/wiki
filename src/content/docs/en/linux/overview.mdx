## What is Linux?

Linux is an open-source operating system kernel, which can be used to build an operating system.

## What is the GNU in GNU/Linux?

Main article: [GNU Core Utilities from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Core_Utilities)

GNU (AKA The GNU Core Utilities, or just `coreutils`) is a collection of utilities that make up the GNU operating system.

It is a package of various common apps and utilities that are used by UNIX-like operating systems.

## What are Linux distributions?

A Linux distribution is an operating system that is built on top of the Linux kernel. It is a collection of packages that are packaged together to make a complete operating system.

A Linux distribution may come in many different forms, and made for different kinds of use cases.

There are many different Linux distributions, and each one has its own unique features and benefits, such as:

- Ubuntu
- Pop!\_OS
- Linux Mint
- Fedora Linux
- The Enterprise Linux family (RHEL, CentOS, Rocky Linux, AlmaLinux, etc.)
- Arch Linux
- Android
- Ultramarine Linux
- etc.

Ultramarine Linux itself is a Linux distribution that is based on Fedora Linux, and many concepts that apply to Fedora Linux are also applicable to Ultramarine Linux.
