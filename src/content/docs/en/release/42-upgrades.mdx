import Alert from "../../../../components/Docs/Alert.astro";

We're proud to announce that upgrades to Ultramarine Linux 42 (Heart of Gold) are ready right now in your edition's app store!

Ultramarine 42 comes with the usual desktop and under-the-hood changes for our existing users.

## Upgrading

Per usual, everything is handled in your edition's app store. If you're on Flagship, GNOME, or Xfce, it's called Software. On Plasma, it's called Discover.

You may need to update your copy of Ultramarine 41 before the upgrade will become available.

## Command Line

In case the above doesn't work, you can always upgrade through the command line, using `dnf system-upgrade`.

Run the following and follow the prompts:

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
sudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=42
sudo dnf offline reboot
```
