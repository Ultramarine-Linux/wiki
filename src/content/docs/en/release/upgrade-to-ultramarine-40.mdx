title: Upgrade to Ultramarine 40
description: "A temporary notice for the 39 to 40 upgrade path."
---

This page is a temporary notice for upgrading Ultramarine 39 to 40.
For this release cycle, we've decided to release an upgrade path before the full distribution release.
This should let existing users enjoy the new set of packages in 40 sooner.
A full blog post detailing changes will be published for the full distribution release.

## Flagship, GNOME, and KDE Editions

You can use the editon's graphical app store to upgrade your system to 40.
On Flagship and GNOME, this will be GNOME Software, while on KDE, this will be Plasma Discover.

You might need to update your system normally before the upgrade to 40 shows up in the app store.

## Pantheon Edition

The Pantheon upgrade path isn't ready yet.
While all of the required packages are in the UM and Terra repositories, the Pantheon desktop environment is broken for a variety of reasons.
We are currently working with upstream and other partners to resolve this, but it's possible that Pantheon may be skipped, deprecated, or deferred until mid-cycle.
If you are interested in contributing to Ultramarine Pantheon, please join [our chats](en/community/community) and let us know!

## Command line

In case the above doesn't work, you can always upgrade through the command line, using `dnf system-upgrade`.

Run the following and follow the prompts:

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
sudo dnf install dnf-plugin-system-upgrade
sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=40
sudo dnf system-upgrade reboot
```
