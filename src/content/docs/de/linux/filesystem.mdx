The Linux (and UNIX) file system is a hierarchical structure of files and directories that make up a Linux operating system.

In Linux, everything is a file. Unlike Windows where there are many other object types that can either be a physical device, and inter-process communication is done by a kernel call.

## The File System Hierarchy

The file system hierarchy is a set of directories that appear under the root directory `/`. They not only contain normal files, but also physical devices, virtual devices, and various other special files that control the system itself.

The directory structure is as follows:

| Directory | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                 |

## The Home Directory

The home folder is the place where all your personal data is stored. It is a directory that is located under the `/home` directory, followed by the username. It is similar to the `Users` folder in Windows.

In Linux, the home folder is usually more extensively used than in Windows, as it stores all user-specific data and app settings. The system folders are only used when one wants to make system-wide changes.

If an app you don't know asks you for your password or root access, It may be trying to compromise your system. Cases like this are usually uncommon on Linux, but you should be aware of it.
