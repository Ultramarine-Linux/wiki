There are many different ways to install software on Linux.

## The Package Manager

Unlike Windows, most software for Ultramarine Linux is stored in online collections of software called repositories. You can browse and install software (packages) from these repositories using something called a package manager.

### Flatpaks

Flatpak is the primary package manager for regular apps. It installs applications in a sandbox, keeping them separate from anything they don't need to access.

Flatpaks can be installed from **Software** on Budgie and GNOME, **AppCenter** on Pantheon, and **Discover** on KDE.

You can browse the available software in one of these app stores, or on the [Flathub website](https://flathub.org/).

Despite most applications being installed from Flatpak, some apps may not work properly, or may not be available at all. The following sections will help with software in other formats.

### Software Downloaded from the Internet

Sometimes, the software you need may come as a package file downloaded from the internet.

#### RPM Packages

To install RPMs, simply double-click it.

You can also open a Terminal and run:

```
sudo dnf localinstall /path/to/package.rpm
```

(Replacing `/path/to/package.rpm` with the real path, it's usually `~/Downloads/package.rpm`)

#### AppImages

1. Install AppImage Launcher from **Software** or **Discover**. On Pantheon Edition, run

```
sudo dnf install appimagelauncher
```

2. Double-click the file and you're done!

We recommend avoiding AppImages as they are not automatically updated and may have compatibility issues.

### Snap

Snap is a package manager made by Canonical for Ubuntu. It contains a large amount of proprietary applications that you may not be able to find elsewhere.

<Alert type="warning">

Snap may cause your system to run noticeably slower.

</Alert>

To get started, install Snap.

```bash
sudo dnf install snapd
```

Then, verify snap is working

```bash
sudo snap install helloworld
helloworld
```

<Alert type="info">

Snap packages load slowly and may not work at all on editions other than GNOME. We recommend avoiding Snaps.

</Alert>

### DNF

Ultramarine Linux uses the DNF package manager. While this package manager primarily handles system software (like the kernel, and your desktop environment) it can install user apps as well.

```bash
sudo dnf install steam # Install Steam
```

You can also install groups of packages, like full desktop environments or a suite of tools for music production, using the `dnf groupinstall` command.

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Audio Production" # installs multiple packages at once, in this case a suite of music/audio production tools
```

For a full list of available groups, run `sudo dnf group list`
