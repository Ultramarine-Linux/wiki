Android Devices are very common, and (most of the time) extremely customizable. We do not have a target release or full plan at this time, but we will support in the (hopefully) near future.

## Implementation

We are actively debating wether to do pmOS style ports or Halium (like Ubuntu Touch). Join our [community](/docs/community) if you wanna discuss this!
