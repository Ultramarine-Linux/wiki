Hop<sup>dnf</sup> is an app that allows you to switch between Editions or install
multiple desktop environments on your system.

## Installation

The package name is `ultramarine-hop`<sup>dnf</sup> but it is also aliased as `hop`<sup>dnf</sup>.

```sh
sudo dnf install hop
```

## Using Hop

1. Open the launcher (usually by pressing `Windows`, `command`, or the search key).
2. Type `hop`. `Ultramarine Hop` should pop up as the first option.
3. Select the option. A dialog asking for privileges will pop out. Type in your
   password to continue.
4. Select the corresponding action you would like to perform.
   - if you would like to add a new desktop environment to your system, click
     the first option. This will download and install an extra desktop
     environment onto your system.
   - if you would like to remove an existing desktop environment on your
     system, click the middle option. This will remove the selected desktop
     environment from your system. You may only select this option if you have
     more than 2 desktop environments installed, otherwise this option will be
     greyed out.
   - if you would like to switch to another edition, select the last option.
5. Select the corresponding desktop environment / edition.
