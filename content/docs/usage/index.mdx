This section includes tips and tricks that are a bit too specific to get called out somewhere else.

Things like [eduroam](/docs/usage/eduroam) and [advanced keyboard configuration](docs/usage/keyboard-cfg) live here.

If you have a tip or trick to share with the world, consider [adding it](/docs/community/contributing/contributorguide)!
