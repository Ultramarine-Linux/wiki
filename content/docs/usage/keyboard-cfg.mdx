## Layouts

The default keyboard layout is English (US). You may change the keyboard layout in your desktop's settings.

If you would like to type in another language, we have a dedicated [localization guide](/docs/usage/l10n#inputting-in-another-language).

## Remapping Keys

keyd<sup>dnf</sup> is a key remapping tool that works at the kernel level, this means your remapped keys will work regardless of the desktop you use (or lack thereof).

### Creating a Config

1. Make sure you are an administrator
2. Create `/etc/keyd/default.conf` and paste the example configuration below into it. Save the file.
3. Install keyd<sup>dnf</sup> (from [Terra]): `sudo dnf install keyd`
4. Start the keyd service `systemctl enable --now keyd`

Every time you change your configuration, you will need to reload keyd using `sudo keyd reload`

### Example configuration

```ini
[ids]

*

[main]

# Maps capslock to escape when pressed and control when held.
capslock = overload(control, esc)

# Remaps the escape key to capslock
esc = capslock
```

Lines starting with a `#` are comments, they will be ignored by `keyd`.

For more information, read the [Quickstart](https://github.com/rvaiya/keyd?tab=readme-ov-file#quickstart) section from upstream.

### Advanced Configuration

keyd supports more advanced configuration, including:

- Mapping macros
- Key timeouts
- Custom layers / modifier keys (keys that can change behaviours of other keys when held, like shift, ctrl, alt, meta/winkey)
