There are a few notable differences in how files work on Linux when compared to Windows or macOS.

The most noticeable difference is case sensitivity. Windows and macOS are case-insensitive, meaning that `FOLDER` and `Folder` are the same folder. Linux on the other hand is case-sensitive, so `FOLDER` and `Folder` are two different folders.

In Linux, and more widely, UNIX, everything is a file. Unlike Windows which has other object types to represent physical devices.

## The File System Hierarchy

Linux has a standardized file system hierarchy called the [*Filesystem Hierarchy Standard*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard) (FHS). The FHS is contained within `/` (called root, not to be confused with `/root`). Root doesn't only contain normal files, but also physical devices, virtual devices, and various other special files that control the system itself.

It should also be noted that Linux uses a forward slash (`/`) to represent going deeper in a directory, unlike Windows which uses a backslash (`\`)

The directory structure is as follows:

| Directory | Description                                                                                                                                                                  |
| :-------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| /         | The root directory with the all the other directories and files. This is as far back as you can go                                                                           |
| /bin      | A symbolic link to /usr/bin.                                                         |
| /boot     | The bootloader and files used during early boot process. Usually in a seperate partition.                                                                             |
| /dev      | Special device files for various purposes (`/dev/sda` for a drive, `/dev/null` for blank data, `/dev/random` for pseudo-random data, `/dev/tty` for terminal sessions, etc). |
| /etc      | System-wide settings and configuration files.                                                                                                                                |
| /home     | User files. This is where your stuff lives!                                                                                                                                  |
| /lib      | A symbolic link to /usr/lib.                                                                                    |
| /media    | Mount points for when the system mounts removable media, such as USB drives, SD cards, etc.                                                                                  |
| /mnt      | Temporary mount points for media. Usually used when manually mounting a drive.                                                                                               |
| /opt      | Optional packages that may be installed by the user. Most packages don't actually install here.                                                                              |
| /proc     | Process data and kernel information for inter-process communication managed by the kernel.                                                                                   |
| /root     | User data for the root user. Don't confuse this with `/` (root)                                                                                                              |
| /sbin     | A symbolic link to /usr/sbin.                                                                                                                                               |
| /srv      | Shared service data used by server processes, such as web servers and NAS/File servers.                                                                                      |
| /tmp      | Temporary data.                                                                                                                                                              |
| /usr      | Shared application data used by all users.
| /usr/bin  | Executables and command binaries.. Most applications installed from an RPM end up here.
| /usr/sbin | A symbolic link to /usr/bin since UM42.
| /usr/lib  | Libraries required for executables to function. May be also named `/usr/lib<arch>`|
| /var      | Variable data used by system processes.                                                                                                                                      |

<Callout>
You may notice that `/bin`, `/sbin`, and `/lib` are "symbolic links", this is for legacy reasons. In the past, binaries were seperated between system (`/bin`, `/sbin`) and user (`/usr/bin`, `/usr/sbin`). As systems evolved this complexity became unnecessary and clunky, leading to the merged usr setup you see today.

Similarly, in UM42, we completed sbin-merge, which turned `/usr/sbin` into a link to `/usr/bin`. Historically sbin contained binaries specifically for managing the system, but as with usr-merge, this became unnecessary as package management became better.

## The Home Directory

The home folder is the place where your personal data, and most of your apps are stored. It's a folder located in the `/home` directory named after your username. It is similar to the `Users` folder in Windows.

In Linux, the home folder is used more than in Windows, as it stores all user-specific data, settings, and the majority of your apps (Flatpaks). The system folders are only used when making system-wide changes or installing applications from DNF or an RPM File.

## Virtual Memory

[Virtual memory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_memory) is a feature in Linux and other operating systems that allows the system to use a portion of the disk as RAM. This is useful when the system runs out of RAM and needs to use the disk as a temporary storage for data.

Swap comes with many issues, for example, it can reduce the lifespan of lower-cost SSDs, and is too slow on hard drives. To combat this Ultramarine uses memory compression [(zram specifically)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zram).

By default, we compress to .5x of your physical memory. (e.g. 16gb physical memory=8gb zram)

Although this may sound magical, it does come at the cost of your CPU working a little bit harder. Luckily this is not very noticeable on modern computers.

## File system formats

Ultramarine Linux supports a wide variety of file systems, and can be configured to use any of them during installation.

It currently supports most file systems that are supported by the Linux kernel, including:

- ext2, ext3, ext4
- Btrfs
- XFS
- NTFS
- FAT32

And extra file system drivers can be installed, such as:

- ZFS<sup>dnf</sup>

Ultramarine's installer is configured to use Btrfs by default. Btrfs is a modern filesystem with snapshots, virtual volumes, journaling, error correction and compression.

By default, the installer will use all the available space on the disk.
- 2–500 MB for the system partition, this varies by platform:
  - 500 MB for the EFI partition
  - 2 MB for a GPT shim on BIOS systems
  - 16 MB for Submarine on x86 Chromebooks
  - 64 MB for Submarine on ARM Chromebooks
- 1 GB for /boot
- Remainder of the disk is used for a Btrfs partition containing:
  - /home Subvolume
  - /root Subvolume

<Callout>
    The subvolumes don't show sizes as they are dynamically allocated based on usage. Simply, they will grow and shrink as needed.

### Remote Filesystems

Ultramarine Linux can also mount remote file systems from a remote server, using the NFS, SFTP, SMB, and WebDAV protocols. You can connect with your edition's file manager.
