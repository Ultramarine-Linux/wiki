You may have noticed package manager tags (like this<sup>dnf</sup> and this<sup>flatpak</sup>) across the wiki. This shows our recommended way to get that software, either using `dnf` or as a `flatpak`.
This page goes more into depth about package managers, to help you make choices like this on your own.

## Using the App Store
Ultramarine comes with an app store. It's called "Discover" on Plasma Edition, and "Software" on GNOME, Budgie, and Xfce Edition.

You can search for and install all of the software available for Ultramarine in the app store, and it will handle installing RPMs and flatpakrefs from the internet.

You can also install software with the terminal, which we'll cover in the next section.

If you're trying to install something from the internet, check the [Software Downloaded from the Internet](#software-downloaded-from-the-internet) section.

## The Package Manager

Unlike Windows, most software for Ultramarine is stored in online collections of software called repositories. You can browse and install software (packages) from these repositories using something called a package manager.

### Flatpak

Flatpak is the primary package manager for regular apps. It installs applications in a sandbox, keeping them separate from anything they don't need to access.

You can install Flatpaks from your app store, or with `flatpak install` in the terminal.

You can browse the available software in your app store, or on the [Flathub website](https://flathub.org/).

Most desktop apps should be installed as a Flatpak, but in some cases, like with Steam<sup>dnf</sup>, IDEs, or other apps that require access to the system, they may not work. The following sections will help with software in other formats.

### DNF

Ultramarine uses the DNF package manager. While this package manager handles system software (like the kernel, and your desktop environment), it can install user apps as well.

```bash
sudo dnf install steam # Install Steam
```

You can also install groups of packages, like full desktop environments or a suite of tools for music production, using the `dnf group install` command.

```bash
sudo dnf groupinstall "Audio Production" # installs multiple packages at once, in this case a suite of music/audio production tools
```

For a full list of available groups, run `sudo dnf group list`


### Snap

Snap is a package manager made by Canonical. It contains a large amount of proprietary applications that you may not be able to find elsewhere.

<Callout type="warning">

Snap may cause your system to run noticeably slower!

</Callout>

To get started, install Snap.

```bash
sudo dnf install snapd
```

Then, verify snap is working

```bash
sudo snap install helloworld
helloworld
```

<Callout>

Snap packages can load slowly and may not work on editions other than GNOME. We recommend avoiding Snaps.

### Software Downloaded from the Internet

Sometimes, the software you need may come as a package file downloaded from the internet.

#### RPM Packages

To install RPMs simply double-click the downloaded file in the file manager.

#### AppImages

1. Install Gear Lever from **Software** or **Discover**.

2. Double-click the AppImage file, select "Install" and you're done!

<Callout type="warning">

AppImages are not automatically updated and may have issues communicating with other apps and the system. We recommend looking for a Flatpak or RPM instead.
