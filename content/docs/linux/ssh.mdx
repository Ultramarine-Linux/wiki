Secure Shell ("SSH") is a tool used to access a shell on a remote device.

## SSH overview

SSH uses a client/server model where one computer acts as an SSH server[^1] and allows other computers to connect.

## Connecting to an SSH Server

To access a device remotely, the `ssh` command is run from [the shell](/docs/linux/shell), mostly used with this format:

```zsh
ssh [username@]<server url>
```

If you don't specify a username then SSH will attempt to connect you using the username with which you are logged in. Here are some examples:

- `ssh myuser@myserver.com`
  - This will attempt to connect to the server at myserver.com using the username myuser
- `ssh myuser@192.168.1.2`
  - This is just like the example above except you can also specify an IP address instead of a hostname
- `ssh myserver.com`
  - This will attempt to connect to the SSH server at myserver.com using your current username

When using any of the above commands, once connected to the remote server you'll be prompted for a password.

## Running Your Own SSH Server

Start by installing the SSH server:

```zsh
sudo dnf install openssh-server
```

Then start the server using:

```zsh
systemctl enable --now sshd
```
You will be prompted to enter your password, enter it.

Once the above command is run, your machine will begin listening for incoming connections on port 22. You can verify that the SSH server application started correctly by using the command

```zsh
systemctl status sshd
```

You should see output similar to this:

```zsh

```

Check for the field that says `Active: active (running)` to ensure that the SSH server is listening for incoming connections.

If you'd like to stop the SSH server, you can do so with

```zsh
sudo systemctl stop sshd
```

You should see output similar to this:

```zsh

[^1]### A Note about the Word "Server"
It's common to hear the word "server" used but not understand exactly what is meant. Here are a couple examples of how "server" can be used:

- It can refer to a physical machine somewhere
  - Ex: Our email server lost power over the weekend.
- It can refer to a specific _application_ running on one machine (or even a number of machines across the world!)
  - Ex: The SSH server is up so that users can connect.

In this guide we'll try to make it clear to which we're referring.
