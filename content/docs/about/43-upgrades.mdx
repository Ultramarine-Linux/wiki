We're proud to announce that upgrades to Ultramarine Linux 43 (Gas Meter) are ready right now in your edition's app store!

Ultramarine 43 comes with the usual desktop and under-the-hood changes for our existing users.

## Upgrading

Per usual, everything is handled in your edition's app store. If you're on Plasma, it's called Discover. On Budgie, GNOME, or Xfce, it's called Software.

You may need to update your copy of Ultramarine 42 before the upgrade will become available.

## Command Line

In case the above doesn't work, you can always upgrade through the command line, using `dnf system-upgrade`<sup>dnf</sup>.

Run the following and follow the prompts:

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
sudo dnf system-upgrade download --releasever=43
sudo dnf offline reboot
```

### Upgrading Ultramarine WSL System Versions

WSL works a bit differently, to upgrade to Ultramarine 43 WSL, run the following and follow the prompts:

```sh
sudo dnf upgrade --refresh
sudo dnf distro-sync --releasever=43
```
